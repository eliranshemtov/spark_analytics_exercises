Yeah, and they've got company. OK, let's join the party. I'm Michael. I don't know who the hell you think you are... but you're not Michael Turner. You gotta believe me. I'm Michael. -You're not Michael. -I'm Michael! -Come on! -Who's shooting at us? -Rival antique dealers! Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today Come on! Come on! Down here. I'm sorry I haven't been totally honest with you. -So you're not Michael! -We have the same DNA... which makes us kinda the same person. Come on. In here! -Come on, get down. -What is this? This a laundry chute? Eww, it smells in here. It's just dirty drawers. Shh. Be quiet. Don't you try to play footsie with me. Shh. Huh. Will you shut that off? With what? My ass? -Reach in my pants. -Hell, no. You've reached in my brother's pants. ... God. Uh...hello. Mr. Turner. Vas. You caught me at a real bad time. What are you doing? Just hang up. -Would you shut the hell up? -No, you shut up. Don't start-- Can I call you back? Don't bother. The Olsany Cemetery. Two hours. Shit. There's people comin'. ... Quiet. Quiet. I knew I couldn't trust Michael. Always so secretive. Just downright sneaky. Never even told me that he had a brother. Some investigative reporter I am, huh? This antique dealing stuff is just a front, right? You're drug dealers. You're not even denying it. I'm going back to the Balkans where I'm safe. -I told you I'd handle it. -Very smooth. Sir, those were Dragan Adjanic's men. All dead. Well, obviously he thinks you're still alive. OK. By the way... Vas called. We're on in two hours. Olsany Cemetery. As we speak, our field operatives... are staking out their perimeter positions. They'll be with you all the way. So will we. Officer Wells has installed... a G4 satellite tracking device to your vehicle. Unfortunately, that's all we can manage safely. Vas'll be more worried about wire taps than weapons. You can expect him to check both your car and you. Seale is on his way to the money transfer site. We want you to connect the bomb to the computer... and begin the verification process as soon as possible. Most importantly, once you've connected to the bomb... a signal will be established via satellite... between your computer and Wells's here... who'll try to steal the arming codes while you check the bomb. So if they don't have the codes, they can't detonate the bomb. Right, but you may have to stall. You may need to buy them some time. You'll hear three short tones when the process is completed. Once you've heard the tones... you're satisfied the bomb is real... Vas will give me the account number... and I call Seale and authorize the transfer of money. As soon as I get the word from Seale... I'll provide confirmation of the transfer of $ 19 million... from the Midlands National Bank in Grand Cayman. You're gonna give this guy $ 19 million?! I thought you was my man! 19 million?! Actually, it's all digital dollars. Ones and zeros, man. We issue a wire transfer... the receiving bank syncs out a GFX authorization sequence... verifying the funds are available. It'll take his bank 48 hours to realize the money doesn't exist. If the shit hits the fan, you got that watch. Ooh. Then I'll know what time it is... when the shit hits the fan. What's this? Hey, hey! Somebody just walked out with a sweater! That's a panic button. You press that and the cavalry comes in. There are a lot of people counting on you, Mr. Hayes. This is Olsany Cemetery. Almost two million people are buried here. You think Vas is trying to tell us something? Yes. It's Vas. Yes, he's with me. Graffika Road East. Graffika Road East, people. -Is that one of ours? -It's one of theirs. Why does he have someone following us... if he's the one who's telling us where we're going? He's following us to make sure no one else is following us. But someone is. That's what makes it so much fun. They're headed for open country. Don't get too close. Dog One, this is Carolina. Be advised we're on a loose leash. Roger that. Carolina. Here's Mr. Smiley. Get out of the car. Your coats, please. Thank you. Hmm. You must be very trusting people... to come out here all alone, unarmed. What makes you think we're alone? Ah. Straight ahead. -Parish, McCain, come in. -OK. We're in position. Sir. we're in place outside Chotesov Monastery. Ah, here they are. My good friend Michael. Welcome to my church... where we worship money. OK, let's get started. You wanted to look under the hood... so look under the hood. We're online. Let's go to work, people. Casing unit, apex mirror. Detonating block. This is insanity. Just one electrical surge and you'll blow us all to hell. Chill, Michel. I mean, relax. Relax, Michel. Downloading new authentication code. 117 seconds to completion. Now, as soon as I verify... the uranium deflector is of weapons-grade... we can all be on our merry way. Uranium deflector? This is plutonium reflector. Plutonium. That's what I meant. 60 seconds! Michael, why is this taking so long time? I'm running one last diagnostic test. If you stayed on top of things, you'd understand... that the traditional checks are not 100% fool-proof. This last test was designed... by the head of nuclear science at Caltech, a...Dr. Dre. 30 seconds. Dr. Dre, along with Dr. Irving and Professor Griffin... the rest of the Wu Tang Clan, know that it is best... when you have a baseline screen situation... to achieve a pulsopular cataclysmic calibration... or something we like to call the Shaq Attack. Shaq Attack? Yes, named after Dr. O'Neal of Los Angeles... formerly of Orlando. All we need are the arming and disarming codes. I know, but it's a mess. I don't know what's what. We'll have to dump it all to get the two codes. I hope he can stall, because there's so much information. What we're doing right now can help... not only in nuclear energy, but also medicine, food--... I believe everything is in order. Sorry, sir. Have the codes been moved to Jake's computer? -Yeah. -Let's get him, the bomb... and the computer back here on the double. You got the bomb. Now, where is my $ 19 million? Yes, sir. -Show them the money. -Copy that. Vas's account number received. Initiating wire transfer... from Midlands National Bank of bullshit. Man, is Vas gonna be pissed when he goes to an ATM. Fantastic! It's working! Ha! I love it. American and Russians work together again... with Swiss bank accounts. Gentlemen, I hope to see you never again. Heh. Dragan Adjanic. Know any good prayers? You got a lot of nerve showing your face in my church. That's the guy who killed my brother, isn't it? Uh-huh. Michel, what the hell is he doing here? Michel, I told you not to deal with him! What's happening? Very interesting. Vas has been double-crossed by his own men. Come on, shoot him! What time is it, Mr. Hayes? Code red. Code red. Everybody move. Kill him. Here's the computer. There's your bloody bomb. Where's my money? Triple-cross. Come on! Having fun, Mr. Hayes? Don't shoot the bomb, you fool! Don't shoot me, either! -Go! Go! Take the bomb! -I'm going! I'm going! You drive! Go on! Hey, wait for me! Go on! Go! -Faster. -I'm going, I'm going! It's a bloodbath, sir. Vas and his men are dead. Come on, man! You're James Bond! Shoot the tires out or something! -Can't get close enough! -Do something! Throw out some tacks or something! Well, you got your wish. I wish for Jennifer Lopez naked! We've looked everywhere. They're just not here. I have satellite position on them! I can assure you they're there! Wait a minute. Hold on, sir. They lost their tracking device. -Whoa! -What the hell are you doing? Not smooth enough for your ass?! It's not my ass I'm worried about. It's the bomb in the back seat. There's a bomb in the back seat! -Yeah. -We're gonna die! Have a little faith, Mr. Hayes. I'll have a little faith if you give me a little gun! Damn! -You OK? -Here they come! -Pull back, pull back! -Shoot 'em! Shoot the gun! Don't have any bullets! Pull back! -Pull back! -Aah! Pullin'! Hit it! Hit the son of a bitch! Get off! Off! Take a bus! No! Oh! Oh! Whup his ass! Yeah! Oh, shit! Aah! Get him! No! Get him! Kill him! Shoot him! Do something! I got glass in my ass! I want to go to Jersey! I want to see my girl! I want to watch "Oprah"! Put your head in the car! Put your head in the damn car! He's whuppin' your ass! No! No! Take it! Aah! Unh! Aah! Back up! -Come on! Back up! -OK, I'm backin' up! Get the bomb! Get the bomb! -Faster! -Oh, yeah! No! No! Do something! I want my money! Aah! I hate you! I hate you! Unh! ... Oh. I don't know about you... but I'm hungry. Someone give me some good news? Someone give me some good news? Yeah. He successfully downloaded... the arming codes into the computer. They still have the computer. True. But he's put his retinal signature in. "Welcome Michael Turner." Try again. So, obviously they can't access it without Jake. -And when they figure that out? -What do we do now, sir? Make sure Jake's eyes don't meet that computer screen. Right. -Wrong. -Wrong? Sir, eventually someone will break the lock... and access the code with or without Jake. So, basically--... We must find them before that happens. Well, there is the obvious way to flush them out. -We dangle him? -No. We give him a wire... they pick him up, we seize the nuke. If his eyes get anywhere near that computer... we take everyone out, including him. I need an executive finding from the president immediately. So, he's expendable, is that it? You need to get the subject onboard. -Tell him whatever you want. -"Subject." Oakes, we both know this is the only way. Yeah. No! No! It ain't happenin'! No! You want me to be your little worm on a hook! They never heard of Jake Hayes! They don't know I exist! Just let me go back to Jersey, get my girl, and disappear! Hey, man, I'm sorry I'm not Kevin... but even Kevin didn't make it out of this alive. Will you let me show you something? No! That's Jersey. So what? Let's look at where you live. Where Julie lives, your foster mother. These people have a nuclear bomb, Jake. The blast alone will kill thousands. Then comes the shock wave... blowing away buildings, tunnels, bridges... and then comes our old friend, radiation... spread by wind and water... infecting the living and the unborn. I think we--just you and me--... might have a chance to stop it. That's all I'm saying. They've got us in check, Mr. Hayes, and... we can't let them get checkmate, can we? Look... The way I see it, you only got three moves. Attack... retreat... or block. You can't attack 'cause you don't know where they are. Retreat? Boom. Then we block. You could block... but you only got one piece left... and that's a pawn. Sir, these gentlemen wish to see Mr. Turner's phone records. Mr. Turner's phone records are sealed. Unh! Mr. Turner made one phone call to the United States... to Jersey City, New Jersey. Hey! What? No! Ow! Help! -Go, go, go! -Help! What do you want? Just take whatever you want! Shush, shush, shush. What is your connection to Michael Turner? I don't know a Michael Turner! I don't--Who? Him. That's my boyfriend. That's Jake. Did he sell you bad tickets? Y'all still there, right? Yes, we're still here, Mr. Hayes. -Y'all got guns, right? -Yes, we have guns, Mr. Hayes. OK. Make sure you got bullets in 'em. Mm-hmm. Lots of bullets. Answer the phone, Mr. Hayes. Michael Turner Antiques. Jake? Julie! How'd you find me? -Michael Turner? -Who's this! Or should I call you Jake, Mr. Hayes? You have one chance of seeing this woman alive. Take the next plane to New York. Return to your apartment in New Jersey... and wait till I call you. If you are followed, she will die. If you attempt to involve any authorities, she will die. Just let me talk to her! Hello? Hello?! Sorry. You used Julie! She was your pawn, right? -No. -So all this bullshit... about being something bigger than you and me... meant something bigger than me and Julie, right? Will you let me explain? Just get me on the goddamn plane. Go! Let's go! Set up in that corner! It's gotta come up now. Now! -Notify all units... -All right. Yeah. I'm injecting a spread-spectrum transceiver behind your ear. So we'll hear what you hear... and if they take you to the bomb, we'll know it. Hold still, please. Aah! Come on, man! You can't put that in a flower? It'd be too obvious. Now, I'll be linked to you the whole time. That's it. Good luck. There's something I ought to tell you. I know. If the situation gets out of hand... they can take me and Julie out. Don't worry, son. There'll be extra money in this mission. Now, first of all, I'm not your son. Second of all, did it occur to you that I might want... to do something 'cause it's the right thing? Hey, I'm the one with the dead brother... I'm the one who misses his girl... and I'm supposed to put up with your shit 'cause you're a spy? Big deal! Every woman on the planet's a spy! Man, you guys can't even find Saddam Hussein. If you told a woman, right now at 8:00 in the morning... that her husband was sleeping with Saddam Hussein... she'd be able to find Saddam by 8:00 that night, and say... "Saddam, don't you ever come around my house no more!" I did you a favor, OK? You called me! If you talk down to me again, I will beat your ass so bad... you'll be the only guy in heaven with a wheelchair. Better act right before you get smacked right, bitch. The show's over. Go back to work. Bomb on American soil. That's a nightmare we've always talked about. How do you think they got it here? You'd be surprised what you can send by air freight. Did we? Did we use his girlfriend, huh? No, but I'm sure Yates would if he thought of it. Hello. Listen closely. No, you listen closely. I gotta hear her voice. I want to hear her voice right now! You are in no position to make demands, Mr. Hayes. But if it gives you pleasure... No, no! Don't hurt her! Tell me what you want! They want him to wait outside his apartment... for a car to pick him up. We've initiated positions here, here, and here... to set up a tail. How do they shake us? We can assume that they think we're shadowing him. Right. So they may move him 10, 20 times... before they think they've lost us. OK, we got the grey Ford van. Grey Ford van. I wish we didn't have to do it this way. I'm sorry if my plan lacks the perfect precision... with which you've handled the case so far. Radiation detection units are scouring the city... and we've issued portable A.V.G. spectrometers... to all surveillance teams. We need to talk worst-case scenario. Evacuation readiness. Have the National Guard stand by. National Guard, this is Com Center 4. Stand by for instruction. Roger that, Com Center 4. Standing by. They're pulling into the abandoned... St. Francis Hospital, sir. Take positions. We have six viable entry points. Move. -Where's Julie? -Quiet. Do as you're told. Where's Julie? I hope you're going to play ball with us. That's Dragan. Hey, man, I ain't doing shit till I find Julie. What the hell was that? We've lost the audio with Hayes, sir. All right, we move to the contingency plan. Yes, sir. We can't afford to take any chances here. Hit your entry points hard on my command. If it breathes, it dies. Hold it! I think we've got something. Entry teams, pull back. Entry teams, pull back. Here he comes. Get in. OK, they're moving him. Everything's going according to plan. Back on plan, people! Keep your distance, folks. They may do this dance all day long. Get up! You're on your own now, Mr. Hayes. Sir, I'm getting a signal back with Hayes. -See if you can clean it up. -Will do, sir. I'm heading down to communications central. Looks like they're heading back to Jersey. Wonder what the hell they're doing. Sir, what are you doing? Your eyes are going to activate this computer. The only question is, will they still be in your head? Where's Julie? Oh, she's lovely. And she will stay that way if you cooperate. Open your eyes, Mr. Hayes, and look into the computer. Open your damn eyes! No! They're trying to scan his eyes. Jesus Christ, the bomb is in the van. Entry teams, the van is hot. Move now! Cut away his eyelids. Sir, they're gonna take out Jake. -What are we doing? -lt isn't Jake. -How do you know? -They had to have a decoy. Bring the subject out with a bag over his head, you do the math. Faster! Go! Hold your fire! Subject is down. Repeat--Jake Hayes is down. It's not him. The bomb's not here. It's done. Thank you. I'll see you on the other side. Did you use the password? Password? Hey, I don't speak terrorist. But I only counted eight numbered sequences... and you're gonna need the seven-letter password... to activate the mechanism. Bullshit. No, see, that's eight letters. There's no password. The bomb is already armed. Hi. What took you so long? I almost killed somebody. Did they arm the bomb? Yeah. This one just called in the enabling codes. I gotta find Julie. OK, the bomb is hot. There's a fail-safe master built into the detonator. Should give us a short countdown period. -How short? -On the outside, twenty minutes. -What's the inside? -Five to ten. Did they say where the bomb was? No. She's not here. When we find the bomb, we'll find her. Did they say anything? Just think. Try and remember. Come on. -Think. -Redial. They called in the codes! OK, hold on. Gimme the address to this number -- 431 974. I need this address. Listen, listen. Take me that address. I need it now, not later! OK, it's coming up. It's coming, yeah. Listen up, folks. 89 East 42nd Street. 89 East 42nd. Wait a minute. That's Grand Central Station! That's three blocks from here. Come on. Support can move out and be there in twenty minutes. -Get out of the way! -CIA. Coming through. -Out of the way. -Move, move. Get out of the way! Go! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move it! Move it! Get out of the way! Move it, move it! Out of the way! Move it! Move it! Out of the way! All right, the call originated from over there. Could be anywhere. This is one hell of a place to blow up. Times Square is a few blocks away. Power grids--... The whole infrastructure of the city could collapse. -I'm getting something here. -What's that? This is a low-energy gamma scintillation probe. -I left mines at home. -The case is lined with lead. We'd only get a hit if we were within 100 square yards. But we got a hit, right? Yeah, the auto range indicates it's here. In here? Here where? It's right here. The signal is constant. It's under us! Come on, let's go! Please evacuate the building. Get out of the way! Move! Signal's getting stronger. CIA. Need your help. Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Move, move, move! This way! This way! -Out of the way! -Come on! -We're real close! -What's in there? -Lost luggage. -Open it. -This lock's been tampered with. -Get away from the door! Jake, get the bomb. I'll cover you. Why don't you get the bomb, and I'll cover you? OK, I'll get the bomb. Jake, go, go! Julie! No, no, hold on. Jake... Jake, where are you? -I'm coming! -It's in the final phase. Three minutes, then it's good-bye to half of Manhattan. I need you here for the enabling codes. You said if we found the bomb, we'd find Julie. -I need you here now! Come on! -Jake, I'll find her. -Ohh... -You're bleeding, man! -You're bleeding! -Now listen to me. When they scanned your eyes, you saw the codes. Try and remember them. Whenever I hear numbers, my head converts them... into chess moves or seats at the Garden. That's the only way I can remember. Take your time. Just relax. You know the codes. You can do it. I know you can. OK, queen's bishop 3. Across from mezzanine section... 3...0...4! OK, let's see. I saw a queen's bishop 3... aisle seat in section... 142. 142. 2 more to go. OK, I think I got it. Did you find her? Touch that bomb, she dies. Keep going, Jake. The bomb goes off, everybody dies. Two more numbers. He'll learn what death is. Your country grows fat... while people all over the world starve. You stay at home, you watch our blood spill on television. War reduced to video games. He's stalling, Jake. Enter the codes. Now! You take sides in conflicts you know nothing about... dictating to other people how they should live. You're so keen on playing God... well, now's your chance to meet him. I'll give you three seconds, then I'll kill her. Go ahead. One... Two... No. I'll kill you. Three! Move, move, move! -Jake-- -Honey, honey, honey... I love you. Let me do this. Rook 643. OK, OK. One more, one more! A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Move, move! Well, that's done. That's it? That's all it does: beep beep beep? That's all we wanted it to do. It's all good. It's OK. Clear, sir. Go ahead. Go! Go! Officer Seale is down, we'll need a medic. It's OK. It's OK. -Where's the bomb? -Right here. -How much time do we got? -Mr. Hayes defused the bomb. Don't worry. I've got you. Oakes has been hit. Stay with me. I love you. -I missed you. -I missed you, too. People, we did it. But which star is your brother's? There are no names, Ma. Agent identities are never revealed, even after they die. But they're all honored right here. Their names are written in this book... their families sign it, and then the pages are sealed forever. It's a book of forgotten heroes. Nah, they're not forgotten. Jake. Hey. Thanks for keeping me off that wall. -Well, stay off of it. -All right. Ma, this is from me and Julie. I just hope it brings a little joy in your life. Oh, I knew you'd make me proud. Oh, this is just such--... Oh, good Lord! $90,000--... No, that's the wrong one, Ma. Here, this is yours. This is for when we get married. Oh, 10,000 is much more than I need. -Then give some back. -Ha ha ha! Hey, honey, can you walk Ma to the car? -I gotta talk to Oakes. -Yeah. Congratulations on your engagement. So I'll see you at the wedding, right? Good-bye, Mr. Hayes. Oh, I see. No personal attachments. -Jake, get this. -I got it. Hey! What's up? What's up, man? Congratulations, Mr. Hayes. Oakes, you didn't RSVP. I figured weddings weren't your thing. I'm on a new assignment. If you're supposed to be undercover at a black wedding... I think you the wrong guy for the job. An old friend of Kevin's escaped from Riker's island. I don't care if he escaped from Temptation Island... I'm not going nowhere. I just got married. Can't a brother get a piece of cake? The guy who escaped is Carlos Palmeros... the world's foremost assassin. I don't care if it's Carlos Santana... the world's foremost guitarist. The world's foremost assassin--... that's like the Tiger Woods of murder. Well, Kevin was responsible for putting him away. The problem is, he thinks you're Kevin... so he's coming after you to kill you. Ohh! No, no, that's not happening. ... I just got married, I'm gonna go off with my wife... I'm gonna be happy for two years... and I'm gonna be miserable for ninety... just like everybody else. Ha ha! I got you. I got you! So there's no killer? No. Not yet. So you just came here for my wedding? I wouldn't have missed it, not for the world. Oh, I get it. So you and Swanson are next. Me, no. I'm never gonna get married, not again. Never gonna get married again. First thing you gotta learn... is don't take your girlfriend to a wedding. We may need to call on you in the future. It's your wedding present. From us at the Agency. Two tickets to Hawaii. I can't take this, Oakes. Jake, sweetie, come on. Your wife is calling you, Mr. Hayes. Husband. Get in the car... bitch. Hey, Oakes! Never say never.
