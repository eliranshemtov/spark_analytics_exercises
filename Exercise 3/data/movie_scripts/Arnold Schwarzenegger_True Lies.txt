-Honey, I'm home. - Roger that. Copy at the boathouse. Right on time. Faisil, getyour butt in here. Harry's inside. Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming. - Hey, wereyou born in a barn? - Whorehouse. All right. You got your fur-coated razor blade there... and a bunch of guys with guns. I'm switching to sub-vocal now. Check, check. - Check,, check,. - It's talk radio. - You're on the air. - Check. That guard nearest to you is moving away. He's at the service door. He's inside. Have you seen Khaled yet? Yep, there he is. How come billionaires are always short? Excuse me. Thankyou. Colonel! How areyou? - It's so good to seeyou again. - Yes, it's been a long time. - Terrific. - Who was that guy? Could you hold this for a second? Thanks. You should be crossing the main foyer, heading forthe stairs. Keep moving. Keep moving. I'm in the library, heading out to the second-floor balcony. Modem in place. Transmitting now. Affirmatory. It's a good hook-up. These are encrypted files. It's going to take me a few minutes. I got your password. - Magnificent, isn't it? - Yes, quite. I thought I knew Khaled's friends, but I don't believe I've metyou before. We haven't met, because I certainly would remember. Renquist, Harry Renquist. - Juno Skinner. - Juno Skinner. Come on! "Juno Skinner, arts and antiquities dealer... specializing in ancient Persia." This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken. Very good. Sixth century BC, to be exact. - Doyou like the period? - I adore it. We got a problem. Guards are going apeshit down there. Acquired most ofthese pieces forJamal. Doyou tango? Tango? Harry,you do not have time to tango, buddy. You copy? Don't be stopping to smell the roses now. You hear me? - You gotta get out of there. - Yes! Files are unlocked! Fast Faisil strikes again. I'm in. I'm down, baby. I got my hand up her dress, and I am going for the gold-- Just copy the goddam files, okay? Wow. And I thought this was just gonna be... another bunch ofboring bankers and oil billionaires. Seconds count. Ditch the bitch. Unfortunately, I have to leave. I have a plane to catch. Well, call me sometime. My offices are in Rome. I would like that. Son of a bitch is with her two minutes, and she's ready to bear his children. Twinkletoes, what'syour exit strategy? I'm going to walk right out ofthe front gate. Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy. Sir, may I see your invitation, please? Sure. Here is my invitation. Shit. Here we go. Slight change in plans. Stay! We're en route to the lower rendezvous point. Repeat, back-up rendezvous point! - Watch it! - It's called ice, and it's slick. - Harry, doyou copy? Whoa! - I got it. Shit! Whoops! Oh, my God! Whoa! I got it! I got it! I got it! - There he is! - Shit! Hi, guys. That worked good. Right out the old front gate. Can you lean back a second? Let's go. We can still make our flight. All right, that's it for Mr Renquist. Okay, go. We got Harry Tasker billfold, Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub. Hotel bill, Tasker. I got two postcards here from Geneva. Got some house keys right there... and I've got a souvenir Swiss snowing village. - What's that for? - It's for Dana, stupe. Bring your kid home a gift, the dad thing. Nice touch. - Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00. - Will do. The debriefing is at 1 000. - Seeyou at 8:00. Bye. - Hey, Harry. Did you forget something? What a team. Sleep fast, buddy. Hi, honey. How wasyour flight? - It was fine. - Good. Broughtyou a little gift from Switzerland. Snowy village. Wow. Thanks, Dad. - I've never had one ofthese. - You're welcome. You're late for school. You better get going. - Don't forget to feed Gizmo. - Okay. It's pretty lame. - I'm late. - Yeah, me too. How'd it go at the convention? Make all the other salesmen jealous? It was fantastic. You wouldn't believe it. You should have been there. We were the big hit ofthe show. With that new model ordering system, the 680 I told you about... I can write up an order and immediately... as soon as the customer's name comes up, you see what his credit line is... what he has ordered in the past, what discount he has gotten. - Every little detail. - Sounds great. It's fantastic. That's why I love the computer business. Listen, the plumber called. He says he has to dig under the slab or something that's gonna cost $600. - That's okay. - It's not okay. It's extortion. What did you tell him? I slept with him and he said he'd knock off $1 00. That's good thinking. Bye, honey. Hello! Boy, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon. - Good morning. Go to school. - Yeah, I am. Thanks, dear. Check these out. Check them out. Where's the image coming from? Got a CCD camera and a transmitter in a pack of smokes out there. It's pretty cool, huh? What the hell? Bye, Dad! - She's rippingyou off. - I knew it. Let's go! Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad! God. Shit. Kids. Ten seconds ofjoy, 30years ofmisery. I got married three times, but at least I was never dumb enough to have any. She shouldn't be stealing. I taught her better than that. You're not her parents any more, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. Five minutes a dayyou spend with her can't compete with that bombardment. You're outgunned, Daddy-o. It's not just becauseyou're a bad parent. Kids today are ten years ahead ofwhere we were at the same age. - Morning. - Morning, MrTasker. - I betyou think she's still a virgin. - Don't be ridiculous. - She's only-- What is she now? - She's 1 4. - She's only 1 4. - Her hormones are going like an alarm. It's even money she lets that physicist on the bike boink her. - Not Dana. - "Not Dana." Denial. It's not just a river in Egypt no more, is it? She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion. Why don'tyou open the door? Or drugs. Twenty here, 50 there. I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it. He takes everything else. There's never a beer in the goddam fridge. - Thoughtyou moved out. - I had to move back, in. My lawyersaid it'd give me a bettershot at getting the house... during the property settlement, but don't change the subject. - You still owe me 200 buck,s. - Good morning,Janice. - Good morning. - Identify yourselves to the scanner. - Harry Tasker, 1 0024. - Albert Gibson, 34991. All right, Frances. I don't believe we need you any longer now. Thankyou. Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed the pooch last night, didn'tyou? Would you please tell me how I can see this as anything but a total disaster? "Total" is a strong word. There are different degrees oftotality. It's a scale, really, with a perfect mission on one end... and then a total pooch screw on the other, and we're more on this-- Faisil, you're new on Harry's team, aren'tyou? Yes. So what makesyou think the slack I cut him in any way translates toyou? Let me showyou what we got. Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty, so we raid his private financial files. One hundred million in wire transfers from the Commerce Bank International. Which is a front for certain countries to finance terrorist activities. That's why we think something really big is going down. We know that a week ago four MIRV warheads were smuggled... out ofthe former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. We think Khaled's group bought the nukes and is trying to bring them to US soil. So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentlemen. Don'tyou have anything remotely substantial? Harry, doyou have any hard data? - Nothingyou would call rock-hard. - Actually it's pretty limp, sir. Then perhapsyou better get some... before somebody parks an automobile in front ofthe White House... with a nuclearweapon in the trunk. It's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake. Whenever I can't sleep, I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. He acts like he's curing cancer or something. I guess this meansyou didn't get away for the weekend after all. - Harry had to go out oftown. - I'm shocked. Yeah, well, you know Harry. - What's up? - Check this out. There's a $2 million disbursement from Khaled to Juno Skinner. That's right. The babe at the party. That doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled. He keeps his antique buys on a completely separate ledger. This is a little above market rate for the horizontal bop... even for a total biscuit like her. I want a complete workup on her. - Do we know where she is? - Right here in River City. She lives in Rome, but she does stuff for the Smithsonian. She has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices here. I guess it's time to send in a specialist. - Care to tango? - Yes, I would. Assholes. It's all set up. You got a fax machine, ghost phones, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under the name of Renquist. Reality check. Let's go. My name is Harry Renquist. I own an art consulting firm in San Francisco. I have an appointment with Miss Skinner. - Harry! - Hello. Hello. I thought I'd seeyou again. I just didn't know itwould be so soon. - What's the point ofwaiting? - I agree. Your clients are looking for something forthe lobby oftheir new headquarters? They would like to see something very dramatic. That's a nice piece. I talked to a number of people, and they all said you're the one to see. Really? Checking on me. So what did these people say about me exactly? That you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words... and other art dealers and archaeologists don't like you very much. Those wimps. It's because I use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures... from countries which tell them to take a hike. Most of our pieces come from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria. Not the most popular places lately. So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy. Well, Mr Renquist? Doyou see anythingyou like? Maybe. Give me a break. I don't think they bugged my tuna sandwich. She's importing stuff from all over the Mideast. She could be moving money, guns, anything. The second you left, we started getting calls to the ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front. Let's step up the surveillance and put on two more guys. Maurizio, I said Saturday, not Tuesday. Saturday. Miss Skinner, may I have a word with you, please? Stupid, undisciplined bitch. It's a good thing you're paying me a lot of money. Doyou realize there are surveillance teams watching this place right now? Yourtelephones are almost certainly tapped. And you were busy laughing and flirting like a whorewith this Renquist-- He checked out okay-- We do not tolerate mistakes. What would you like me to do? Find out where this Renquist is. Hello, Tektel Systems. MrTasker's office. Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen. Is he in? Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs Tasker. Let me try him in there. Hold, please. Relay, 1 0024. It's a patch from Tektel. It's Helen. Hello, honey. How areyou? What's going on? Hi. I'm sorry to botheryou in the middle ofa meeting. It's just that Dana and I want to make sureyou were gonna be home by 8:00. We're going to a lot oftrouble foryour big birthday. We justwanted to make sure thatyou were gonna be home. Absolutely. This timeyou can count on me. - Promise? - Trust me. - Great. - Got to go. Bye. Bye. - That's disgusting, Dana. - Calm down. We got a friend. Three cars back on the inside lane. They've been on us since we left the hotel. - You mean the station wagon? - Yes. - You want me to lose them? - No. We need this lead. Unit Seven? Seven here. We needyou at the Georgetown Mall in three minutes. - Copy. We're rolling. - Helen's gonna be pissed. This is the problem with terrorists. They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules. Pull over here. This is good. - Okay, testing, one, two, three. - I got you. I got you. I got you. They're right with us. I make three of them in the car. - Dickhead. - Blow me. I got a couple of them getting out of the car and coming afteryou. Think I'm blind? You do look, lik,e Ray Charles. So what's the plan? Just trying to get a closer look at Beavis and Butt-head. - There's a third one still in the car. - Stay on him. Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib. Oh, not much. Listen, Harry forgot something back at the office. You know Harry. Yeah, Gib, I know Harry. Bye. Bye. Seeyou soon. See? I lost the third guy. Shit! Shit! Hold it! Shit! Here. Cool off. Sorry about this. Look out! Get out ofthe way! Hey! Freeze! Oh, thank God. Get in the car. Here we go. Federal officer in pursuit of suspect. Sorry. - Harry, what's your 20? - Westbound in the park. Suspect is on a motorcycle, and he's coming out on Franklin. Copy! I want you on 1 4th in case he turns south. I want Seven on the north side to box him in. Make it quick, because my horse is getting tired. Your horse? - There he is! That's him! - Come on! - Go around to the back. - Copythat. Out of my way! Out of my way! Sorry. Excuse me. -Jesus! - Sorry. Open it! Excuse me. Excuse me. Out of the way! Move! Move! Move! Federal officer! Get down! Now! Get off or die! - Get down! Now! - Move! Turn around! Hold still! Come on! Whoa! Hold still! Will you press the button for the top floor, please? Thankyou. Help! Shut up! Whoa. Say something. That's a fine animal. Stay against the glass! Come on. So sorry. Stay there! Don't move! Come on, come on, come on! Okay, back up. Back up. You can do it. Come on. Good horse. Good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now. Come on. Yeah, that's teamwork now. Keep pulling. Come on. A little bit more. That a boy. Okay. What the hell wereyou thinking? I had the guy, and you let him get away. Look at me when I talk toyou. What kind of a cop areyou anyway? Hi, honey. I know you're upset. I'm sorry. I hurried home as fast as I could. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. Thankyou for the party. Yeah, it was great. Hey. That's him. - Pause it right there. - Salim Abu Aziz. This guy is really hard-core. Highly fanatical. The man's a real psycho. He's been linked to dozens of car bombings. You know that cafe bomb in Rome lastyear? That was his. As well as a 727 out of Lisbon. This guy's a major player. Now he's formed his own splinter faction called Crimson Jihad. I guess he thought the other terrorists were too warm and fuzzy for him. - They call him the Sand Spider. - Why? Probably because it sounds scary. This is impressive, gentlemen. It would be even more impressive ifyou actually knew where he was. We'll get him. - Why don'tyou pull over here? - What's up? I really screwed up with Helen last night. I'm going to see if she's available for lunch to smooth things over. - You just want me to hang? - Just hang. I'll just be hanging. Hold, please. - It'syour mystery man on two. - Simon? Oh, my God. Hello? Simon? Simon? Yes, I can talk. You mean right now? Yes, I can meetyou. Okay, I can't wait. Bye. Can you cover me for an hour? Just an hour? You should tell that stud to take more time. Would you shut up? I should have never told you about him. Have a good time. Get a little bit for me whileyou're at it. Hey! Hold it! Fucker! What's going on? Sick? Looks likeyou got gut-kicked. It's Hel-- It's Helen-- It's Helen. It has something to do with Helen, I'm guessing. Helen... is having an affair. Welcome to the club, man. It can't be. Not Helen. Nobody thinks it could happen to them the first time. Same thing happened to me with wife number two, remember? I had no idea nothing was going on. I come home, and the house is empty. She even took the ice cube trays out ofthe freezer. What kind of a sick bitch takes the ice cube trays out ofthe freezer? - It's not Helen. - Helen still loves you. She just wants to bang this guy for a while. It's nothing serious. - You'll get used to it soon-- - Stop cheering me up! What'd you expect? Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman, and you're never there. It was just a matter oftime. I say we concentrate on work. That's what I do every time my life turns to dog shit. I concentrate on work, and that gets me by. Right, buddy? It's gonna be great. We're gonna catch some terrorists. We're gonna beat the crap out of them. You're going to feel a hell of a lot better. Watch your head. Okay. All right. Women. Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em. I came byyour office today. I was in the area, and I thought you might want to have lunch. Really? Well, you must have just missed me. That's what they said. They said you had to run out or something. It was this rush job-- They needed these documents down at the district courthouse. So, of course, the big problem-- our printer shut down. So I went to the third floor to use theirs, but they have the 1 720. Of course, the disk isn't formatted for the 1 720. So I had to go back upstairs and reformat... go back downstairs and use their printer. By the time I got there, I couldn't get my car to start. Then traffic-- I barely got there. So a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did it work out okay? Yeah. Great. I'll check on dessert. I'm done. The great thing is that he's practically given us a blank cheque on wiretaps. I set them up on all ofJuno's shipping agents and her clients. Faisil's made a list ofall the possible contacts... the Crimson Jihad may have in this country. Now all we have to do is sit around-- Hey. This national security stuff boringyou? - Put a tap on her phone. - What? I already did that. I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap on her office line and the house. Now. Come over here for a second. That sounds great. I want to askyou about something. I got two words to describe that idea-- In-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's a felony. You know that. And you're doing it 20 times a day, so don't give me that crap. Do it. - Hello? - Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk,? Yes, go ahead. I can't talk long. Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow? I must see you. I suppose so. Where? Same place, 1 :00. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I needyou. I thought that we might have lunch together tomorrow. You know-- darn it-- I'm going to meet Allison. We're going to go shopping. Sorry. No problem. I thinkyou're going about this whole thing all wrong. Women-- they likeyou to talk to them. Maybe it's just thatyou're not in touch with yourfeminine side. I waswatching SallyJessyRaphael-- All right. I got all the usual stuffhere-- a telemetry burst transmitter. I got a GPS tracker, an audio transmitter and a power supply. I've got it sewn into the lining here-- Hey, Harry? Ifyou need to talk, speak into the purse. Here she comes. She's gonna pop out right in front of us. Watch this. Bingo. Looks like she's going into Chinatown. She's parking. Okay, give me audio. You sureyou weren't followed? No. I kept looking behind me like you taught me, but I didn't see anyone. Okay, it's just that things are a bit hot right now. If I get a signal, I may have to leave suddenly. I understand. Look, it's my job to take risks, but not yours. I feel bad about bringingyou into this, butyou're the only one I can trust. Were you out on a mission? We say "op," covert operation. And this one, well, got a little rough. - Worse than Cairo? - Cairo. Cairo was a day at the beach next to this. - The guy's a spook. - But forwhom? He could be working her to get toyou. - Did you read the papersyesterday? - Yes. Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation. You see two men killed in a restroom and two unidentified men... in a running shootout, ending at the Marriott? That was you? - Me. - You're very good. You recognized my style. You're a natural at this. The guy's a fake. He's taking credit for our moves. - What happened? - Hardly worth talking about. Two ofthem won't bother me again. - Unbelievable. - You chased one? Something came over me. I had to nail this guy no matterwhat the risk. Pretty hairy. I thought he had me a couple oftimes, but I-- - I really can't take credit. - Why not? It's the training. It shapesyou into a lethal instrument. You react in a microsecond without thinking. I'm starting to like this guy. We still gotta kill him. That's a given, you know. The guy is a goddamned used car salesman. This keeps getting better and better! I'm sorry. I know this has gotta be painful. But you gotta admit it's funny. If it was just some idiot, not you... you'd be laughingyour ass off. One born every minute. It wantsyou too. Feel it vibrate? - Say, how about a little spin? - Sure. See, it's not just a car. It's a total image. An identity. You have to go for it. This isn't some high-tech sports car. To tell you the truth, it doesn't even handle that great. But that's not the idea, is it? What are we talking about here? Pussy, right? Absolutely. Let's face it. The 'Vette gets 'em wet. But it's not enough. Ifyou really want to close escrow, you gotta have an angle. I suppose you have an angle. It's killer. I mean, look at me. I'm not that much to look at. No, no, no. I can be honest. But I got 'em lining up, and not just the skanks either. - Well, some are. - What'syour angle? No, sorry. Trade secret. Okay,just askyourself: What do women really want? You take these bored housewives married to the same guy foryears. They're stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure, a hint of danger. I create that for them. So basically you're lying your ass offthe whole time. - I couldn't do that. - What areyou, a Boy Scout? Think ofit as playing a role. It's fantasy. You gotta work on their dreams... get them out oftheir daily suburban grind for a few hours. - What about their husbands? - Dickless! I mean, let's face it. Ifthey took care ofbusiness... I'd be out ofbusiness, you know what I mean? Those idiots. You mind keeping it under 90? I'm still trying to pay for this dental work. So, who areyou working on right now? I always got a couple on the hook. There's this one right now, I got her panting like a dog. - It's great. - What does she do? Some sort oflegal secretary or something. You know, uptight and conservative. But she could be so hot if she wanted to be. And with you, she gets to be real hot. Red hot! Her thighs steam. It's like a dying plant. Just needs a little water. - Married to some boring jerk. - Some boring jerk? He doesn't appreciate her. She's like all these babes. You get their pilot lit, they can suck-start a leaf-blower. She's got the most incredible body, and a pair oftitties... makeyou want to stand up and beg for buttermilk. Ass like a ten-year-old boy. So, then she must be really good in bed then, huh? Slow down. You'll miss the turn. See? You and this carwere made for each other. Why fight it? Sure, I got a couple other buyers on the line, but I likeyour style. So, what doyou say? Should we start up the paperwork? Let me think about it. Hold it for me for a day, okay? Hey, because it'syou. I got today's transcripts. Not much going on. - Nothing from Simon? - No. - My turn to drive? - Give me the page. - What? - This jumped from page 9 to 1 1. - Where's page 1 0? - It's gotta be a typo. Give me the goddam page! - Seek help, Harry. - Hello? Helen, I need your help. Can you meet me tonight? - What's happened? - It's serious. Meet me on K Street... under the Key Bridge, 8:00 sharp. Gotcha. Shit. It's almost 8:00. She's still at the house. Thepurse is still at the house. Shit. Unit Two, Unit Seven, immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge. Vehicle is red and white convertible. You got exactly six minutes. Wait a minute. Areyou out ofyour mind? You can't pull agents off a priority surveillance to followyourwife. That's a misappropriation ofresources and a breach ofnational security. You copy? You're losing it big-time, man. - I have to stop you. - What areyou gonna do, tell? Look, goddam it. Both of our butts are on the line. Soyour life's in the crapper. Yourwife's banging a used car salesman. It's humiliating, I know, but take it like a man! -You tell on me, I tell on you. - What areyou talking about? I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets. I'm as clean as-- What about when you blew a six-week operation... becauseyou were busy getting a blow-job? You knew about that? Let's take Franklin. It's quicker. Quick, get in. Hurry up. Let's go. Two here. Suspect vehicle in sight. One male, one female. Now, don't be alarmed. If I'm spotted, it'd be best ifthey didn't seeyou. You should keep your head down till we're out ofthe city. Here, let me help you. That's better. Nowthe woman has herhead in the guy's lap. Southbound on the Key Bridge. Two in pursuit. Roger, Two. One to Condor, you got a visual? Roger, One. This is Condor. Subject is in sight. Repeat: We have the ball. We got a pretty good lock,up on infrared. She's got her head in the guy's lap, all right. Maybe she's sleepy. This is a safe house. My place in the city is a little too hot right now. So is the penthouse in New York. What is it exactly you need me to do? I want you to be my wife. But I'm married! It's just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man travelling alone. You want me to go to Paris? Paris, with a quick stopover in London. There's a double agent in my outfit. I don't know who. There's no one I can trust, except you. Can you get away, just for a couple of days? I just don't know. Of course. I'm rushing you. Forgive me. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Let me pouryou some more wine. I'll do it. I'll do it. You just saved my life. You are incredibly brave. I have to remind myself ofthe fearyou must be feeling. You see, for me fear is not an option. Now, in order to pull this cover story off... we have to look like two people who are completely intimate with each other. The enemy can spot a fake easily. - You see what I mean? - Sorry. That reaction could get us both killed. - I'm sorry. - We can't afford that. Try to relax. It's just been a long time... since anybody but Harry's touched me like that. - It's a little difficult. - I know. - It's awkward for me too. - I'm sorry. - That's all right.Just sit back. - I'm okay. There. That's better. Just let yourself slip into the role. That's it. There you go. Just let yourself go. That's good. That's great. That's it. No, I can't do this. I can't do this. - What's wrong? It's okay. - I cannot do this. I cannot do this! If not for me... do it foryour country? Oh, God! Don't hurt me! I'll do whateveryou want! Please! I didn't do anything! Damn it! Take her! Take her! Oh, God, don't hurt me! Son ofa bitch! Sit down. Isaidsit down. Who doyou work, for? Stern, Kessler, Goldstein & Krumpnick. - I'm just a legal secretary. - Sure, Mrs Tasker. What wereyou doing with the international terrorist... Carlos theJack,al, tak,ing dictation? How long have you been a member of his faction? I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whoeveryou say he is... just a couple weeks ago. I barely know him. That's not what it looked like when we found you. How did you meet him? Well-- Keep this for me. I can't afford to be taken with it. - What? - It's a matter of national security. Please, it's important. I'll contact you. Oh, shit. Why didyou continue to see him? He said he needed my help. Not becauseyou were attracted to him? You were not attracted to him at all? Well, maybe just a little. -So, is cheating a common thing foryou? -Never. So you're telling me this wasyour first time? I wasn't cheating! Tell me aboutyour husband, MrsTasker. What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company. So sex with him isn't exactly wavingyour flag any more? That is none ofyour goddam business! What kind of questions are these? You're in a lot oftrouble, so I suggestyou cooperate. Ifwe want to know the most intimate details about your life... you'd better tell us. My husband is a good man. But he's not exactly ringing your bell these days, is he? Let me handle this part. Doyou mind? Why didyou go to Carlos'hideout? He wanted me to go to Paris with him on a mission... to pose as his wife. And you agreed? Why? I don't know. I guess I neededsomething. What did you need? I needed to feel alive. I just wanted to do something outrageous. And it felt really good... to be needed. And to be trusted. And to be special. It's just that there's... so much I wanted to do with this life... and it's like I haven't done any of it. And the sand's running out ofthe hourglass... and I wanted to be able to look back and say... "See? I did that! I was reckless and I was wild and I fucking did it!"

She lovesyou. Now what? There's only one solution toyour problem, Mrs Tasker. You must work, forus. What areyou doing? - Just giving her a little assignment. - You gotta be shitting me! She wants a little adventure, so I'm gonna give her one. I'm offeringyou a choice. Ifyou work for us, we will drop the charges... and you can go back toyour normal life. If not, you will go to a federal prison... andyourhusbandanddaughter will be left humiliated and alone. Yourlife will be destroyed. Gee. Let me think. Yes orno? Of course yes. What's involved? You will be contacted with the assignment. The code name ofyour contact will be Boris. Your code name will be-- - Natasha? - No. Doris. Pricks! You son of a bitch. Did you think you could elude us forever, Carlos? Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon. Just let me go. There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your face-- Don't! I didn't see it! I didn't see it! It'syou! Hey, you still interested in that 'Vette at all? Hey, Carlos. The game's over. Your career as an international terrorist is well documented. - No! - Oh, yeah! I sell cars. That's all! Come on. I'm not a terrorist. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever saw a gun I'd-- Oh, God! Oh, please, don't! Don't kill me! I'm not a spy. I'm nothing! I'm navel lint! I have to lie to women to get laid. And I don't score much. I got a little dick. It's pathetic. Oh, God. Would a spy pee himself? Huh? Please, I'm not worth a bullet. - Have mercy, sir. - Get the fuck out ofhere. Just beat it. Go on. As soon as I turn, you're gonna shoot me! You're gonna shoot me! Please! You can have the car for free. What do you say, huh? Get lost, dipshit. So last night must've been pretty exciting foryou. My flat tyre? Actually, it was a little scary... because the tow truck driver took such a long time. I'll get it. Hello? Doris? Yes? Listen carefully. In exactly one hour, go to the Hotel Marquis. Pick, up an envelope mark,ed "Doris" at the front desk,... - and dress sexy. - What? No, no. Turn around. Do it doucement. Do it very slowly. You've reached a new all-time low. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the suite at the Marquis. Doyou think I can afford a suite like this on my salary? - IsJean-Claude doneyet? - Hang on. Who wrote this shit? Harry? It's going great. Doyou have an envelope for Doris? This is Doris. Listen, you are a prostitute named Michelle. Go to the room. There will be a man there. He is a suspectedarms dealer. Now, wait a minute. You don't expect me to, uh, you know. No. He has particular tastes. He lik,es to watch. Tell him that his regular girl, Carla, is sick. Ifhe lik,esyou, he will tellyou what to do. You must plant the bug... nearthe telephone bythe bed beforeyou leave. Ifyou do not complete your mission... the deal is off. I'm gonna go to hell. Have some champagne. Come in here. My name is Michelle. Carla thought you'd like me. Let me do the talk,ing. You may start by unzippingyour dress. No, no. Turn around. Do it doucement. Do it very slowly. Good. Now slip the dress down slowly. Good. Now slide your nylons off one by one. I'm not wearing any. That's good. Now, dance for me. Dance sexy. Let your hands be your lover's hands on your own sk,in asyou move. Now lie on the bed and closeyour eyes. I thought you only liked to watch. Now lie on the bed and closeyour eyes. You pig! Bastard! Wait, wait, wait. Yes, it's Harry. I know it looks bad, but I can explain. Nobody move! Don't move! Helen, just don't do anything. No, he has nothing to do with it! I'm the oneyou want! Shut up! Quiet, Helen. Do what they say. Come on, guys, let the hooker go. She's not important. You don't need her. Harry, please, just let me handle this. Shut up! What were you doing there? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Talk again and I'll kill you! I wish I could say it's nice to seeyou again. You know her? You know, this shade's totallywrong foryou. Sowho'syour little friend? I'm Helen Tasker. Harry is my husband. And you are? So now it's Tasker, not Renquist. She's just some wacko hooker I met down at the bar. What is the matterwith you? Just tell her the truth! We are married, and we have a daughter. I don't know what the crazy bitch is on. You should cut her loose so we can get down to business. Where did I get this then, huh? Where did I get this? Something before takeoff? That hurt, you b-- She was telling the truth, wasn't she? She really doesn't know. How interesting. Bring them. Incredible, aren't they? I call them the Four Horsemen. They're warrior figures... from the Persian Empire of Darius I... around 500 BC. They're absolutely priceless. Pity. Wait, wait! Open it. Doyou know what this is? I know what this is. This is an espresso machine. It's a snow cone maker. That's what it is. Is it a water heater? Doyou know why you've been brought here? So that this man can verify to the world... the Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power. How can he do that? He's just a salesman, for Christ's sake. If I'm wrong about him, the last thingyou'll see... will beyour blood spraying across his face. It's a Soviet MIRV-6 from an SS-22 air launch vehicle. Thewarhead contains 1 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium... and a plutonium trigger. The nominal yield is 30 kilotons. What can I say? I'm a spy. You bastard! You lying son ofa bitch! - Sorry, honey. - Don'tyou call me honey! You don't ever get to call me honey again! You understand me, you pig? And I can verify that they have the arming box... and all the equipment necessary... to detonate all fourwarheads. You have killed ourwomen and our children... bombed our cities from afar like cowards... and you dare to call us terrorists? Now the oppressed have been given a mighty sword... with which to strike back at their enemies. Unless you, America... pulls all military forces out ofthe Persian Gulfarea... immediately and forever... the Crimson Jihad will rain fire... on one major U.S. city each week... until our demands are met. First, we will detonate one weapon on this uninhabited island... as a demonstration of our power... and Crimson Jihad's willingness to be humanitarian. However, ifthese demands are not met... Crimson Jihad will rain fire... on one major American city each week-- Battery. Get another one, you moron. I think I have one in the truck. - What? - Look at this. - That's not mine. - Nice transmitter. Miami Tower, Jet Star 6479 Delta on final. - We'll be on the ground in 1 2 minutes. - All right. Tell those D.E.A. boys to have the helos... hot and ready to fly in 1 2 minutes. Signal's definitely stopped moving. It's an island in the Keys. - We lost the signal. - Shit! All right, everyone. This is Samir. For 50 points, see ifyou can guess his specialty. Oral hygiene? - Not exactly. - What's going on? Samir's just gonna ask Harry a few questions. We're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir's absolutely first-class. On the other hand we have Harry, who's managed to lie convincingly... to the woman he loves for 1 5 years. So it'll be interesting to see how long he can resist. This will help. You know, you should swab that with alcohol. I might get an infection. I'll return when this has taken effect. Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics... and I'm getting a lot of money. What, you think I care about their cause? Oryours? Not at all. You're damaged goods, lady. Did you tell her about us? There is no "us," you psychopathic bitch. Oh, sure. You say that now. Thanks for everything. It wasn't bad while it lasted. Let's go. You two stay here. There was nothing. I swear. What did they give you? Sodium Amytal, or some other truth agent. It makes you tell the truth? Is it working? Ask me a question that I normally would lie to. - Are we gonna die? - Yep. I'd say it's working. They're gonna shoot us in the head, or they're gonna torture us to death... or they're gonna leave us here and let the bomb-- How long have you been a spy? Seventeen years. Have you ever killed anyone? Yeah, but they were all bad. Is there anything you want to tell me before we start? Yeah. I'm going to kill you pretty soon. I see. How, exactly? First, I'm going to use you as a human shield. Then I'm going to kill this guard over there... with the Patterson trocar on the table. And then I was thinking about breakingyour neck. And what makesyou think you can do all that? You know my handcuffs? I picked them. Let's get out ofhere. Come on! Drop the gun! Honey, next time, duck. - Let's go. - I married Rambo. What are they doing? It is done. In 90 minutes, a pillar ofholy fire... will light up the skies... to show to the world... that we speak the truth. We are set on our course. No force can stop us now. We're cool, we're bad-asses, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ifwe're on an island, why are they using trucks? We must be in the Florida Keys. The overseas highway connects the islands to the mainland. There's no borders, no customs. They can go anywhere in the U.S. There's nothing to stop them. Just us. - Here, take this. - Oh, shit. Shoot! Shit! Let's go. My condolences to the widow. We may need the hostage. Okay, let's go, Suzy Homemaker. Hurry up! Just get her in the car. Let's get going. - I thought this looked like yourwork. - Let's go. I'll briefyou in the air. You're welcome. Let's go! Let's get out ofhere! Let's go! Come on! Well, you tell that son of a bitch this is a Bright Boy Alert. I repeat: A Bright Boy Alert. This is not a drill. Do you understand that? Hold on. Put me through to the White House. The minimum safe distance is 1 2 miles. Get the marine patrol in right away. I want the Coast Guard and the sheriff's department too. Anyone that cannot make that distance, you gotta get 'em out by air. You've got exactly 34 minutes. I can get you two Marine Corps Harriers here in 1 1 minutes. - They're on manoeuvres outside Key West. - Get them. - I'll briefthem on the way in. - Send 'em in right away. Would you like one? I want the state police driving through the streets on their damn loudspeakers. Here they come. Lime-Zero-One, got a tally on three truck,s eastbound on the bridge. Roger, Lime-Zero-One. You're clear to engage. Ringo is padlocked. In hot with guns. Let's get some. Ok,ay, marines, time to k,ick, ass. Recommend using your Mavericks to take out the bridge. Rogerthat. Lime flight, switch Maverick,s. Two. These missiles won't set off those nukes, will they? That's a negative. Fire. - Bingo! - Good shooting, marines. I'll kill you! - It's out of control. - Somebody capped the driver. Bitch! Like one? How about two? Get down to the limo! Come on! Take it down! Let's go! - Get down! - Take it down. - The bridge is out! - What? The bridge is out! I can't hearyou! What? Oh, God! The bridge is out! Come on! Come on! Speed up a little bit, now. Get down there. Come on! Hurry! Hurry, Harry! - Grab my hand! - Come back! - Okay, to the right. - I can't reach! Get lower! Here we go! Hold on! Hold on really tight! Harry! Come back! Pull up! Grab my hand! You can do it! I can't reach! Oh, God! Please! Harry! Oh, shit. Come on, baby. Hold on! I gotyou! - Oh, God! - Hold on tight! Let's get this thing on the ground. Let'sget these aircraft on the ground. We got a nuclearbomb going off in about one minute. Any minute now. Go, go, go. Come here. Give me a bullhorn. All right, it's show time. Do not look at the flash. Do not look at the flash! We should be safe here. This is the wrong finger. Come here! - Go to work. - Okay. Bye. Aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes ago on top of a high-rise in Miami. He rendezvoused with some faction members. They're on the 20th floor. I got SWAT down there. The cops cordoned offthe area. They got a hostage. It's Dana. What do you mean? My Dana? I'm real sorry. I don't know what to say. I guess he grabbed her in the middle ofthe night. We just found out about it. But I don't wantyou to worry. We'll get her back. I've got a guy on the inside. Listen. We're gonna get her back. Here we go. Excuse me, Captain. I got to borrow your plane for a minute. Listen, Force Comm cleared you to give us total cooperation, right? And you know that comes directly from the president ofthese United States. But, sir, you're gonna have to sign for this aircraft. I'll sign for it. You got a pen? You take care ofit. Doyou realize it has been ten years... sinceyou've been behind the wheel of one ofthese? I break it, they can take it out of my pay. Listen, we got a guy on the inside. Gotta move back, everybody! Let's go! All right, everybody, it's gonna be all right! He's got hundreds ofhours in the Harriers there. He is a little rusty, but that's a trademarkTasker takeoff. It's like riding a bike. You never forget, really. We might wanna seek shelter! Sorry. Fuck! The streets are filled with people aspolice try to evacuate the buildings. They appearto be shooting wildly into the air as I'm speak,ing. These seem to be warning shots. So far... they have not fired at us orpolice. This apparently is the same group... which just detonated a nuclear bomb in the Florida Keys. Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major U.S. city each week,... until our demands are met. This tape was released to the media just minutes after the terrorists-- I have to go to the bathroom. We'll repeat the tape following this live report from the scene. Hold your fire! - The video crew you wanted is here! - Send them! They're coming in. They're unarmed. Come on. Let's go. Go. This is a communique from Crimson Jihad. You have seen a demonstration of our power. Do not force us to destroy this city... and do not try to use force against us. I, we are all prepared to die. With one turn ofthat key... two million ofyour people will die instantly! - What key? - That key! Who's taken the key? Shoot her! Holy shit! Unit One to Unit Seven. Give me a situation report. One to Seven. Give me a sit rep. Faisil, do you copy? Seven here. 2 1 st floor secure. About 1 2 faction members on the 20th floor. No hostages there. - Where's Dana? - She's on the roof. Ok,ay, stayput. Give me that address again. You shoot me, this'll fall! Stay where you are! Stay where you are! - Give me the key! - I'll drop it, I swear! Give me the key. Come on, child. You don't want to die, doyou? Give me the key and you won't get hurt. I giveyou my word! No way, you wacko! Help me! Please don't come any closer! Help me! Help me! Somebody! Dana,jump down! Jump down! Dad? Help me! Daddy, come back! Daddy, get me down! Jump!Jump! Daddywill catch you! -Jump! - I can't! Hold on! Don'tyou let me fall, please! - Daddy! - I gotyou! I'm slipping! Help me! I'm gonna fall! Hold my hand! Hold on tight, honey. He's behind you! Take this plane down, now! I'll kill her! Take it down, now! My God, do something! You're fired. It's okay. Honey, it's over. Hi, pumpkin. Just seconds afterthejet landed... the unidentifiedpilot was escorted from the scene by Federal agents. Though it is unclear at this moment which agency was responsible... for the operation which ended the terrorist threat... so dramatically early this morning... we've learned from Miami Police-- Do it properly. One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war. Five, six, seven, eight, try to keep your thumbs straight. Don't! Stop it! - Wait! - I got you! Just listen. Listen to the rules. - Hello? - Boris and Doris? We're on. Yes? Go ahead. Colonel, how nice to see you again. Good evening. Who was that? What's the scoop, team? You see your contact yet? Haven't seen him yet. But I see somebody I'd like to say hello to. Let me pouryou some more champagne. I got to keep up the waiter bit. These stakeouts can be tricky. You never know when things might explode into a life-or-death situation. If it gets rough, stay low until it's over and I'll contactyou later. - Maybeyou should give meyour-- - So, we meet again, Carlos. Honey, I'm just gonna do him right here, okay? Go for it. Oh, God. Fear is not an option. Dance? - Tango. - Here we go. Harry? Helen? Guys? Come on, now. Let's not get distracted. We got some work, to do. All right, guys. Come on. You guys better get serious in there. I'd be serious ifl was in there. Don't ignore me, Harry. That's rude. All right, guys. Come on. National security, guys. Come on. Life and death. Helen, I was always on your side. I was always there foryou. You know what? I'm sick of being in the van. You guys are gonna be in the van next time. I been in the van for 1 5 years.
