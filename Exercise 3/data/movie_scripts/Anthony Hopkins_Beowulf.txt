How can you blame them, your legend is known from the high seas and the snow barriers, to the great island kingdom. - You are the monster slayer. - We may nah the monsters now.

Someone give him a sword... or I'll... I'll... You'll what?! Kill me? Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me! You know why you can't kill me, my friend?

You're so beautiful and so young. You know Ursula, when I was young I used to think that being a king was about battling every morning and counting the golden loot in the afternoon. Swerving a beautiful women every evening... But now... nothing is as good as it should have been. Not even the "swerving a beautiful woman every night" part, your majesty? - Well... Some nights for sure, some nights... - Perhaps tonight? No, tonight I fell my age upon me. Tomorrow after the celebrations. We can't forget what tomorrow is, can we now? Your day, when the song of Beowulf is told. Of how you lifted the darkness from the land. And the day after that, we celebrate the birth of hallowed Christ. I see you survived. At last, my queen.

Needs to see what? Lost, and now found. The gift fit for a king, do you recognize it? - Where did you find this? - On the moors, my slave, Cain found it on the barren hill where nothing grows. I beat him for threading near such unholy place. My lord, isn't this...? So, lord Beowulf... it's come back to you, after all these years. - My lord, this is the slave who found it. - Please, please don't kill me. - Where did you found this treasure? - I'm sorry I ran away, master. Please don't hurt me no more. - Answer your King! - Stop! Stop! - Where? - Up... up on the moors, but I was going to give it back master, I swear. Is that all?... No demon, no witch... no woman? Look at you, you are nothing, an empty nothing. Come forth! Show yourself! Even with all your riches, your kingdom, your power, your glory, and your women... Which one do you think I should kill first? Your pretty little pet-woman, or your crazy queen? What are you? I am something you left behind... Far behind... Another restless night? It's all right, girl, I'm not going to eat you. He has bad dreams, they've been coming more often. He's a king... and kings have a lot on their conscience. - He calls your name in his sleep. - Does he? - I believe he still holds you in his heart. - Do you? - I often wonder... What happened? - To us? Too many secrets... God, help us. - What... what do you want from me? - I have a message for my father. - Tell me, what did this? - I saw a whole village burn. Children screaming and dying. - I saw it, your majesty, vomiting fire and smoke. - Damn you! What was it? - A dragon. - It's Unferth my lord. - Unferth? - You say a dragon did this. Stop. You had an agreement, you would not be harmed. But now the golden horn has return to you, - the agreement is ended. - Who!? Who said that!? "The sins of the fathers... " it's the last thing I heard. The last thing before my family... was burned alive! Sins of the fathers! Sins of the fathers... Sins of the fathers!

But bare him a son. - I don't want anyone else. I want you. - I am not the man you think me to be. You are a great man, and a hero. This I know to be true. Then you are as foolish as the rest of them! Very impressive, dear. But the armor suited you better when you were younger. I'm sure it did. Why don't you take that poor girl, and live out your remaining years in peace. Let some young hero save us. What? And let the nightmare... start all over again? No. I visited this horror upon my kingdom. I must be the one to finish her. Her?... Was she so beautiful, Beowulf? Her beauty so costly? Beautiful, and full of fine promises. I was weak. I am sorry. So... So sorry. - I have always loved you my queen. - And I you. Keep a memory of me. Not as a king, or a hero. But as a man. Fallible and flawed. - This is the place. - Where you'd slain Grendel's mother. Wiglaf, I have no sons and if this demon kills me, I have arranged with the Harrods... - that you shall be King. - Don't speak of such thing, my lord. - Great friend, there is something you should know. - Nay! There is nothing I should know. You are Beowulf! Beowulf the mighty, the hero! The slayer and destroyer of demons. Now let's kill this flying devil when he sleeps, and go on with our bloody lives. Do you want me to go in with you? Good. Beowulf, it has been a long time. Take your damn horn, and leave my land in peace. Too late, my love. Like a (?) He's heading for Wealthow. Hrothgar. Damn you! I'll have your lizard head on a spike! My lord?! - Over here! Attend the queen! - Attend the queen. I told you, we were too old to be heroes. - Let's get you to a healer. - Not this time old friend. You are Beowulf, a little thing like this isn't gonna finish you off. Do you... hear her? I hear nothing. - Grendel's mother, my son's mother, my... mine... - No my lord. You killed Grendel's mother... when we were young, they sing of it. Too late for lies, Wiglaf, too late... He was... the bravest of us. He was the prince... of all warriors. His name will live forever. His songs... we will sing forever.
