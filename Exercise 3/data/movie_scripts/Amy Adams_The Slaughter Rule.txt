That's why Gid wants to jaw at ya. Barn's throwing up a football team. He wants gamers, from all over town. Boys like you. Well, boys� with touch. Yeah. Well, we're talking full on tackle football. We're talking six-man. Six-man, isn't like a ranch kid game? Well, isn't that what you is, a ranch kid? That's the last thing I am. Oh, no, it ain't a thing to be shameful of. Well, ranch kids are tough. You have to be. You raise a pet pig, then you kill it. We-we don�t raise pigs. Oh, well the point is, town kids don't know if they're tough. In six-man, in six-man, you got no place to hide. No, you miss a tackle. And boom! Yeah, scary to some kids, bub, it's scary! Long night, that�s all. No-no, that's all right. Shh, shh, shh.

You all right, Ms. Bowser? Yeah. Just your ordinary everyday heartbreak. Oh, is that all? Well, I thought it might be something serious. Now, we have 64 and that looks good. This ain't my first rodeo, Chunt. I hail from west Texas. Six-man's a religion down there. I speak it's tongues. That's good. Why me? You got your daddy's blood. And that's good blood. You know-knew my dad? I told you, Gid knows everybody. Your daddy was a mighty fine ball player. All state three years running. He was a real� sledgehammer, sledgehammer, yeah. I've heard that before. Course you only knew smash my arm. He was just a� tackle� grunt� like me. But you, Roy, You're better than that. Six-man, it takes smarts. You get to run a gun, you get to think on your feet. What do you get? Oh, I get to coach again, bub. Yeah. I get to be bull-goose. Now I'll run my boys against any action in the state. And if you sign, you got a cannon, right there. Boom, boom, boom. Roy. You can own this game. You can have somethin' that nobody ever gonna take away from you. You're my lynchpin. Without ya, I got no team. You in? Hey, Skyla. Gid Gid Please bud, will you stick me in? Floyd! Come on, sit down. 5, we have a winner. You look awful ragged. Ragged, did you say? �Ragged but right�, Riley Puckett, 1934. Don't mind, Floyd. His�his diabetes and his drinking just disagree. Folks call me Studebaker, 'cause I live in one. But, my name's Floyd. What do you go by, mister? Roy. He's Roy Chutney. My new quarterback, right champ? You know that's trouble sure and true kid. Nothing but trouble. Oh, �nothing but trouble�, Floyd, Lonnie Johnson, 1949. So, how 'bout it, son? You in? Yeah! Yeah! Atta boy! Yes, sir! Yes, sir. All right, listen up. In six-man, you never stop moving. It's high-octane, hardscrabble. You got to be, outlaw, out there. You got to be Renegade. Let's get friendly. Over there, this is, uh, Quirky Lovoy. He'll put you on the back of your helmet. This is Josh Coudrow. He's our special teams. Now this is, uh, Jeremy Areala. Got Dave Bishop here. A hard time, getting a helmet over that hat. Down there, Warren Hudson. We got us, Benton Toranjos. Mr. wrong way, Toranjo. And Lester and Earl Bucket. Now they're new to football, but their old man owns this field. So be nice. Now, Gibbs, he played six-man, right? At Valley Christian. Yeah. 'til he left the team for, um, well religious reasons. What's that? I called the coach a cock sucker. And hidden over here, this is Roy Chutney. He's our big boss with the hot sauce. He's our bull-roar, our deepback. Gid, uh. This helmets are ancient. Oh, be broadminded, boy. It's not the helmet, it's what fits inside. All right, where's that ball? Okay, now deepback. He's just a, he's just a quarterback but don't get the hike. He gets the ball through a-a hand off or a pitch. That way he's always got the option to throw or to run. That's it, Roy. Run it again. Run it again, keep it going. Now, all of you. You're always eligible to receive a pass. So always be on your ready. Now remember chums. In six-man, a broken play may just be your best bet. Go, go, go, that's it! Yeah, you got it! Let's play some football. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Now, get down there. Now, hike, stand back. Come on, come on. Strip it away, strip it away. Strip it away. Oh! Now it's play it. That's it. Hey Roy, take your office. I�m uh� I got some business needs tending too. All right, Gid. All right, let's run it again!

Well, I don't know about that, but you're more than welcome to try. We got us some games. We got us some games! Come in here, everybody in. Everybody in! And one last thing! The slaughter rule! If either team gets ahead by 45 points, they call the game. But, Gideon Ferguson, he never been slaughter ruled. And I aim to keep it that way. Okay? Today, I was in uh, I was in ceramics class. And up comes Motlow. �So what have we made today, Mr. Two Dogs� And I said �ma-many things for flowers� �Mr. Two Dogs, that-that's not a vase.� �It�s a water pipe.� "Nuh-huh, that-that's not a water pipe." �Today, Mr. Motlow, we had made a bung.� No, you didn�t!
