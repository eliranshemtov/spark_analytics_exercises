- Okay. I'll go first. Um- - Okay. Let me say, uh, we don't really need to be here. See, we've been married five years. - Six. - Five, six years. And this is like a checkup for us. Um, a chance to poke around the engine... maybe change the oil, replace a seal or two. Yeah. Very well then. Let's pop the hood. On a scale of one to 10, how happy are you as a couple? - Eight. - Wait. Ten being perfectly happy and one being totally miserable? - Or- - Just respond instinctively. Okay. - Ready? - Ready. - Eight. - Eight. How often do you have sex? I don't understand the question. Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a one-to-10 thing? Like, is one very little, or is one nothing? Because, you know, tech-technically speaking... the zero would be nothing. That's right. And if we don't know what one is-What's 10? - Yeah, 'cause 10- Oh, God. - Constant. Uh- - Unrelenting. - N-Not stopping for, like- I mean, just- - Nothing to eat. Like Sting. Well, look at Sting's day job. Who else has 60 hours a week to put in the sack? It's not a one-to-10 scenario. It's a basic question. How often do you have sex? How about this week? - Including the weekend? - Sure. Describe how you first met. Uh, it was- It was in Colombia. Bogot�. - Five years ago. - Six. Right. Five or six years ago. Hey. �Qu� pasa? Hmm? No. No, no, no, no. Est� bien. She's with me. Est� bien. I'm Jane. John. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet ya. - To dodging bullets. - To dodging bullets. So, it speaks. - But does it dance? - Hiya, stranger. Hiya back. I think room service fled. I did what I could. Thank you. Mm! Oh, that's good. - I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it. Hey! Step right up! Ladies and gentlemen, try your lu- How about you, little lady? Wanna try your luck? Win a prize. Hmm. Yeah. All right. - Two. - We got two over here. - Do you know how to hold it? - Step right up! Five shots. Five dollars. - Yeah. - Yeah? - You gotta aim. - [Laughing] I am. Don't laugh. I'll kill you. - You didn't blink. Would you like to win a stuffed animal for your little girl? - Come on. - Ooh. Everybody's a winner. Do we still get somethin'? Beginner's luck. - I wanna go again. - We're goin' again. Everybody's a winner. Win a prize. Win a prize. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? Beginner's luck. Stop. Stop. You've only known the girl for six weeks. I'm in love. She's smart, sexy. She's uninhibited, spontaneous, complicated. She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen! I knew Gladys for two and a half years before I asked her to marry me. You have to have a foundation of friendship, brother. The other stuff fades. Hi. So, you don't think this is all happening a little fast? You know me. I never do anything without thinking it through. What does he do? He's in construction. He's a big-time contractor. A server goes down on Wall Street... she's there anytime, day or night. She's like Batman for computers. He's gone as much as I am, so... it's perfect. I give the whole thing six months tops. Eddie, I asked her to marry me. - What? - I'm getting married. - What? I can't hear ya. - I'm getting married. - I can't hear him. Can you stop hittin' him? I think he said somethin' crazy. I'm getting married! I'm getting married! - Gotta get these filters changed. - Mm-hmm. What did you think of Dr. Wexler? - His questions were a bit wishy-washy. - Yeah. Sorry. - Not the most insightful. - No. His office is clear across town. You know that 4:00 means we hit rush hour. I'm not crazy about that. - So, that's settled then, yeah? - Okay. - Okay. - Dinner's at 7:00. - Yep. I'll be there- here. - Hi, babe. - Perfect timing. - It's pissin' rain out there. Here's your butter. I bring you butter. - How was work? - Eh, so-so. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, I stopped off for a drink with Eddie. - This is salted. - What? It's salted. Is there any other kind? Unsalted. Like I asked for. It's fine. I'll make it work. - Okay. - Oh, I got new curtains. Well? What do you think? - Huh. - There was a struggle over the material. This little tea sandwich of a man- - He got his hands on them first, but I won. - Of course you did. They're a bit green. I think we're gonna have to reupholster the sofas... and definitely get a new rug, maybe a Persian. Or we can keep the old ones. Then we don't have to change a thing. We talked about this. You remember? I remember. I remember 'cause we said we'd wait. If you don't like 'em, we can take 'em back. Okay. I don't like 'em. You'll get used to 'em. - I like 'em. - Yeah. Huh. Zero percent A.P.R. Till March. So, part two. Here we are. Only this time, you came back alone. Why did you come back? I'm not sure really. Let me clarify. I love my wife. Um, I want her to be happy. Uh, I want good things for her. But there are times... [John Sighs] - Honey, would you just- - Five more minutes. So what's the problem? There's this huge space between us... and it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other. - What is that called? - Marriage. What don't you say to each other? Uh- Hmm. The GMC Yukon got three stars. This looks nice. Did you do something new? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? I added peas. Yeah, peas. Yeah, it's the green. Sweetheart, will you pass the salt? It's in the middle of the table. Oh, is that the middle of the table? Yeah. It's between you and me. Okay. - How honest are you with him? - Pretty honest. I mean, it's not like I lie to him... or anything. We just, uh, Have little secrets. Everybody has secrets, you know. Shit. Sorry, hon. - I'll get it. - No, I got it. I got it. Don't move. - Oh, that's me. - [Jane] Jesus! - Honey, you scared me. - I'm sorry, hon. I was lookin' for the, uh- You goin' out? Yeah. Some clown crashed a server in a law firm downtown... and ended the world as they know it, so, yes. Mmm. We promised the Colemans. - I know. - Okay. I'll be there. In and out. Just a quickie. It probably feels like you're the only people going through this. But I'll tell you something. There are millions of couples... that are experiencing the same problems. Uh-huh. - We got a plane in an hour. - All right. Quotes. 800. Prodded about possible insider trading... she remarked on national television... "I want to focus on my salad. " - Brian. - Martha Stewart. - Forty. - I'll match your- What the hell? What's this shite? Sorry. Where's the can around here? - For Chrissakes. - Take a- - Hey, you guys playin' poker? - Private game. Piss off. Hey, could I sit in? You think I can sit in? What part of "piss off" do you not understand? Guys. Hey, whoa, whoa. Be a little friendly. - I got the cash. I got the ca- - [Muttering] Dude, I'm just showing you my bankroll, man. I got the money. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Poker- Don't even know her. So if you want me to sit in, I'll sit in. And I'll play some cards with youse. If you don't, I won't. I just- Fine with me, I'll go. - Jesus. - Here's an empty chair. I could sit right here. That is Lucky's chair. Wh-Where's Lucky? I don't see Lucky. - Lucky's not back yet. - Then I'll sit here. Unless... I'm too hot for ya. - Solid silver. - Ooh. Raise the socks. - Ooh. - "To dodging bullets. Love, Jane." - In the pot. Put it in the pot. - Ohh! Ohh! - Oh, he's pulled something. - He's pulled something. - You're in trouble now. - Sixty dollars, eh? - In! Let's play some poker! - Drat! You've got 14 different tells. - You are bleeding William Tell. - What the hell is this? - Sorry, Lucky. - Looks like you're done, pal. - Thanks for the memories. - Oh, you Lucky? - Yeah. - No kiddin'. What is it, kid? You lookin' for a job or somethin'? - You are the job. Pair of threes. - Have you been a bad boy? - Yes. - Mm-hmm? You know what happens to bad boys? - They get punished. - Oh, yeah. Punish me. Have you been selling big guns to bad people? Huh? Mr. Racin. Mr. Racin. You okay? Oh, Colemans. He's down! On the sofa! - Hey! - Taxi. - Everything okay at work? - Yeah. Here. - Yeah? - And you? How was the game? - The game was good. - Good. Nets in overtime. - You been drinking? - That's right, miss. Welcome, neighbors! - Hey. Hi, Susan. - Good to see you, John. - Hi. - There you go. - Oh, this is wonderful. - Thank you. Oh, I love that. - What a lovely dress. - Thank you very much. So is yours. Come on. Let's go see the girls. Don't stray too far, guys. You want a Cuban? - Oh, no, no, no. I don't smoke. - Oh. - Clean body, clean soul. That's what Suzy says. - Ain't that the truth? - You guys have any vices? - Well, you know. - Can I get you a drink? - Uh, yes. Chardonnay, please. - Girls? - Chardonnay. - Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! - I'll be up here at the filling station. Duxbury's never gonna close that high. I hear their stock's getting butchered. - Hey, boys. Scotch. - Hey, John. - Yes, sir. - It's a bloodbath over there. Johnno. How'd you make out last quarter? You take a beating? - Actually, I got all my dough buried under the toolshed. - So, Chuck got the promotion. - My God! That is so great! - Fantastic! - I'm so excited. We can finally put the addition on the kitchen. Oh, shoot. Not again. I should wear a raincoat. You know what? Would- Can you hold her for a second? - What? No. I'd rather not. - It's all over the appliqu�. - Oh, no, I'm- - Please, just- Oh. Seltzer. - Oh, she likes you. I liked your dress tonight. It was nice. Thank you. - Be there in the morning. Okay. - Of course. - Everything all right? - Uh, yeah. It was- It was Dad. He's a- He thinks he has pneumonia. I'm sure it's just a cold, and you know how he is. He'll be fine. Yeah. Probably. Maybe you should go see him. I think he'd like that. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will. - Good night then. - Who was that? - Huh? - Who was on the phone? - Oh, the Atlanta office. There's a problem with the specs for the dam again. I'll fly in the morning. I'll be gone a couple of days. - That damn dam, huh? - Yup, that damn dam. - All right, good night, John. - Good night. Okay. - There's trouble in Atlanta again. - That's what I hear. - What you got? - I've got your boarding pass and taxi receipts. - Get rid of that gun-gum. - You got a tissue? - And your hotel bill. Now don't lose those. - Thanks. - The door's unlocked. Mornin', pal. - How you doin'? - Same old same old. People need killin'. Oh, Johnny. I might have a little get-together this weekend... at my house. Barbecue. No ladies. Dudes only. It's gonna be awesome. - Yeah. I'll talk to the missus. - You wanna use my cell phone? Maybe you wanna give her a call in case you wanna decide to scratch your ass... or use the head later, make sure she thinks it's okay. You live with your mother. Why would you bring her into this? She happens to be a first-class lady. I don't have to check in with her every time I wanna do somethin'. She cooks, cleans, makes me snacks. I'm the dumb guy? John Smith. Hello, John. - Good morning, Atlanta. Quite the body count this week. We have a priority one, so I need your expertise. The target's name is Benjamin Danz, A.K.A. "the Tank." He's a direct threat to the firm. D.I.A. Custody. They're making a ground-to-air handoff to heli... 10 miles north of the Mexican border. I need you to make sure the target does not change hands. The Tank? - L-Temp Technology Staffing. - Jane Smith confirmed. Stand by for contact. Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation. You know the competition would love to see us burn... so I need you to handle this personally. - Target? - Benjamin Danz. I'm rolling the specs now. - We need this quick, clean and contained. - Yes, sir. - Good morning, ladies. - Good morning. - Hello, Jane. Yesterday's op resulted in one kill and one agent in protective custody. Not good. We'll get him out tomorrow. Another two cases of the G40's. The grenade launchers are here. Order 10 more. All right. Go, Jas. The target's name is Benjamin Danz, A.K.A. "the Tank." - Are you serious? - Yeah. The target's being moved across the border to a federal facility. The only point of vulnerability is just south of the border. I want G.P.S. And S.A.C. Of the canyon... and the weather report for the last three days. Target will rendezvous with the helicopter here at a deserted airstrip. We will have one chance to strike. Are we green? - Perimeter is armed. We are up and running. Red team! Red team! This is Broadway Joe. - Halftime is approaching. - Copy that, Broadway Joe. Oh, come on. - You getting this? - Affirmative. Is it a threat? Countdown's initiated. Convoy is not in the zone yet. There's an idiot in the field. He's gonna blow the charges. - Ah. Okay. You gotta be kidding. Civilians. Let's see if we can't get a tune out of this trombone. We're picking up a weapon signature. Shit! Not a civilian. Oh, man. Asshole. Convoy is in the zone! Countdown is initiated. Whoa! You should so not be allowed to buy these things. Abort! Abort! I think I got I.D.'d on that hit. - You ever been I.D.'d on a hit? - Not that I'm aware of, no. - Right. I think I'm in trouble. - You get a look at 'im? Little thing. Buck 10, buck 15 tops. - Maybe he's Filipino. - Maybe. I'm not even sure it was a him. Are you sayin' that you got your ass kicked by some girl? - That's right. - Really? - A pro. - This should be easy. I mean, how many hitters do you know that are chicks? Right? I'm sorry, man. - You guys want any dessert? - What do you have, honey? - Ice cream. - Ice cream? - That sounds delicious. What flavors do you have? - Chocolate and vanilla. I don't like either of those... separately. But maybe mixed together, that could be... a nice little dish. You know what I mean? And not just a little pink spoon. I'd like the whole sundae. - That could be arranged. - Perfect. Could be arranged. Did you hear that? I'd like to have her kick my ass. - You know what I mean? - Right. Did you get any other details on her besides her weight class? - Laptop. - I'm sorry? You're in a whole zone right now. I'm havin' a hard time talkin' to you. - Laptop. - Okay, laptop. I wanna know who that bitch is! - Get me that tape. Get me that tape. - Jane. - What? - It's Father. The F.B.I. Secured the package. The window's closed, sir. I told you we couldn't afford any mistakes on this one. - There was another player. - We do not leave witnesses. If this player I.D. 'd you- You know the rules. You have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane. Lookin' forward to it, sir. All right. We have a new target. Let's find out who he is. Jesus. What did you do to it? Put a campfire out with it? Buy a new one. This one has sentimental value for its owner. Who's that? Well, Gwen, I'm just hoping you'd tell me. So, uh, why you gotta know so bad anyway? You know me. Just tryin' to return some lost property. - Hey, Phil. - Hey, John. - Are you a vegan? - No. My girlfriend is. Here we go. Upgraded RAM module. Line three. Pick up. Chip's Chinese. Imported by Dynamix. Retailed by, uh- You know, I might be able to get you a billing address. All right. No name. Just an address. 570 Lexington Avenue. Suite 5003. New York. You know the place? Sweet Jesus. Mother of God. Why don't you both go make some coffee? Jane, it's your husband. He's back from Atlanta. He wants to know about dinner. Tell him... dinner's at 7:00. Hi, John. Yeah, she says dinner's at 7:00. It always is. Perfect timing. As always. - This is a nice surprise. - I hope so. - You're home early. - I missed you. Mm. I missed you too. - Shall we? - Yes. Thought you only broke these out for special occasions. This is a special occasion. Mm. Mm! Mm! Mm! Pot roast. My favorite. Allow me, sweetheart. You've been on your feet all day. - Thank you. - Sure. Mm. So, how's work? Actually, we had a- a little trouble with a commission. - Is that right? - Yeah. - Double booking with another firm. - Huh. - Green beans? - No, thank you. You'll have some. I hope everything works out okay. It hasn't yet, but it will. Pot roast is my favorite. Sweetheart, could you pass the salt? - Did you try something new? - Mm-hmm. Mm! So, how was Atlanta? Had a few problems ourselves. Some figures didn't add up. - Big deal? - Life or death. - Wine? - Yeah. - I got it. - I got it. I'll get a towel. Janey? Honey? Jane! Jane! How could I be so stupid? Jane! Jane! - God. Oh, dear God. - Oh. Wait. No, no, no, no. Accident. - Honey? Accident. Jane, stop the car! Now! Jane! You've overreacting! Honey, let's not get carried away. - We don't wanna go to sleep angry.God! Pull over. Pull over! Pull over! - Now, look- We need to talk! [Panting] Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'. Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'. - Who is it? - Open up. - What the hell happened to you? - My wife. - She tried to kill me. - Yes, she did. And you know what? Gladys tried to kill me, not with a car. At least Jane was a man about it. She was up front about it. They all try to kill you- slowly, painfully, cripplingly. And then-wham. They hurt you. You know how hurt I used to be over her, and I used to beat myself up? Now I'm great. I got dates all the time. I just woke up from a thing. I'm in my robe. - You live with your mom. - I live with my mom because I choose to. Because that's the only woman I've ever trusted. Most of them are passive-aggressive. There's a whole psychology. I've been reading books, given what I've gone through. And, uh, it's disgusting. Do you know there is nothing more cruel on this Earth than a 13-year-old girl. They literally form cliques in high school. And they play cruel games on each other. A-And test boundaries with each other. - What are you talking about? - I'm just saying about you have to understand- I'm hurting over here. And you're talking about 13-year-old girls. Because I'm trying to get you past the hurt. You have to understand the enemy- what you're up against. I know exactly what you're thinkin'. If she lied about that, what else is it possible that she lied about? Her job is a spy to get information from people. - French Riviera, a yacht? An Iranian prince? She's supposed to get close to him and gain his trust. It's disgusting. What? What are you saying? What? Your husband is the shooter? That's impossible. Really? This whole thing was probably planned from the beginning. Operation Stake Out Johnny. A six-year stakeout to get information from you. Mission accomplished. Okay. Here's the upside. - You don't love him. - No. You'll kill him, and nobody's better at that than you are. Thank you. And then it'll be over. Mm. - What if she's listening? - What? Do you think it's possible that she rigged the house? - Oh, my God. - Hey, dude. It could be very possible because of th-the pattern of how she's handled stuff. It wouldn't surprise me. That's probably why she doesn't like me. - Because she heard me call her a troll. - You're out of your mind. I'm just saying it's possible. The woman just tried to run you over with a car- That she could hear you. And I don't give a shit. I hope she is listening. I hope you are listening, Jane. You know what, I'm on to you. You might have fooled my boy, 'cause he was blinded. It's okay. She knows this. But I'm not me. I hope you're listening to me. And I hope you know th-that I slept with your friend, Jasmine. Huh? - Shh. - We're on the board. I'm just saying we're on the board my man. Come on. We're on the board. You thought it was 37-0. We got five points on the board. I nailed Jasmine and she was bad in bed, baby. Johnny, I'm not- I know you're embarrassed, but, come on, it's me. It's Eddie you're talkin' to. The guys we work with, they don't know. I'm never gonna tell them. The people she works with probably got a big laugh over this over the last six years. But so what? Who cares? That's not important. Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book have been written. In the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown. You can write the last 10 pages. You've been smoked, but you can write the last 10 pages. Great talk, man. We should do it more often. It was a great talk. - I'm proud of you. - I'm gonna borrow this. - I like where your head's at. - I'll do it in the morning. - You okay? - Yep. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. You don't love him. - Good night, John. - Good night, Eddie. - Good night, Mom. - [Door Closes] Okay, girls, let's go. Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks. You know the drill. This is nice. Who picked this out? - What is this? - It looks like your wedding. - I know what it is. What are you doing? - Research. - Background on the target. - This room is wrapped. Thank you. ... to have and to hold, to love and to cherish. - Till death do us part. - [Jane] I promise. I, John, take you, Jane, for my lawfully wedded wife... - to have and to hold- - [TV Turns Off] It's all coming out of the house. Well done, ladies. Let's wrap it up. - What's going on, Mrs. Smith? - Garden party, girls. - Hi, neighbor. - John, hey. - Hey. - Ooh, pumpkin. It's a big one. Wow. I can't believe I've never been in here before. This is great. - Let's start with the living room. - Oh, yeah. - Oh. Nice floors. They teak or something? - Yeah. Fuck if I know, Martin. Uh, and you won the Golf Masters' trophy this year. - Again. Again. It'll be sittin' on your mantel next year. Bitch. Target profile is our main priority. Utilize all means necessary. Phone taps, credit cards. Audio scan civilian frequencies. Uh, with what, Jane? You've reached the Smiths. We can't take your call right now, but leave a message after the tone... - and we'll get back to you. - [Beep] - And search the database. - For what? John Smith? - Find him. - Uh, Jane. What? - I think I found him. - Where? Here. Heat sensor breach in the perimeter. - Commence scanning all floors. I thought I told you not to bother me at the office, honey. - Well, you are still Mrs. Smith. - Well, so are a lot of girls. Careful, Jane. I can push the button anytime, anywhere, sweetheart. Baby, you couldn't find the button with both hands and a map. - Last warning. You need to disappear. - [Jane] No. - Now. - "D" Sector clear. You really expect me to roll over and play dead? You should be used to it after five years of marriage. Six. And I'm not leaving. "E" Sector clear. Uh-huh. Anywhere, anytime. Intruder detected. Evacuate. Plan "C." Evacuation in progress. Evacuation in progress. Evacuation in progress. [Woman] I've already done this side. Let's go! Chickenshit! Pussy! You're tellin' me you had a shot at her and you didn't take it? You're tellin� me you had a shot at her and you didn't take it? What I'm trying to say is we got all this stuff here... and you're trying to tell me you couldn't take her out? Well, now she's a problem for both of us. Now my house is priority one. Just give me a hand, will ya? Please. You're driving me crazy with the tongs in the furnace. You're like an insane man. All right. They gave you 48 hours. What do we got left here? Twenty-three? Twenty-two? Eighteen and change. - You got 18 hours until they close the book on both of you? - [Woman] Eddie. Mom! We're on high alert here! I almost killed you right then! You do not even realize! Never mind. I am so done playing games with this broad. You gotta take this bitch out head-on. Don't tell me how to handle my wife. This broad is not your wife. She's the enemy. And she could be outside right now! Eddie. Got it. Now we're talkin'. Only question is how much is it to buy a vowel? - Blackbow Realty. - Yes. Hi. I'm calling from l-Temp. Oh, great. How's that new penthouse working out? Well, just fine. Thank you for asking. This is security. There seems to be a problem with your elevator, sir. Do you want an engineer to come up and, uh, see what the problem is? Take your time. I'm really quite comfortable. Are you really comfortable? Jane? Is that you, sweetheart? First and last warning, John. Get out of town. You know I'm not goin' anywhere. Oh, well, so you say. But right now you're trapped in a steel box, hanging 70 floors over nothin' but air. Oh, so this is a trap. He's in car three. It's never gonna work, honey. It's never gonna work because you constantly underestimate me. - Do I? - You have no idea who I am. You have no idea what I'm capable of. Well, back at you, baby. Let me guess. Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable. Two more on the primary and secondary brakes. Maybe? - He found them. - Yes. Thank you. Did you also get the base charge at the principal cable? Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it. Okay. I give up. Blow it. - What? - Go on. Blow it. - You think I won't? - I- I think you won't. Okay. Five, four- - Any last words? - The new curtains are hideous. Good-bye, John. - What the hell was that? - What? You said good-bye. - Shut off the gas! Madame. Thought of a number of lines for this moment. "Thought I'd just drop in." - "Hey, doll. Thanks for givin' me the shaft." - Nice. So, what did you decide? I want a divorce. I like it. You proposed to me here, so it has agreeable symmetry. Coat, sir? - May I sit? - No. [Gun Cocks] - Champagne, sir? - No. Champagne's for celebrating. I'll have a martini. I'm fine. Thank you. I like the dress. I'm in mourning. You should wear it more often. So, what do you want, John? We have an unusual problem, Jane. You obviously want me dead. - Hmm. - And I'm less and less concerned of your well-being. So, what do we do? Do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best? Mm. Well, that would be a shame... because they would probably ask me to leave once you're dead. Dance with me. You don't dance. Just part of my cover, sweetheart. Was sloth part of it too? Ow. You think this story's gonna have a happy ending? Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet. Satisfied? Not for years. That's all John, sweetheart. Why is it you think we failed? Because we were leading separate lives? Or was it all the lying that did us in? I have a theory. - Newly formed. - I'm breathless to hear it. - You killed us. - Provocative. You approached our marriage like a job- something to be reconned, planned and executed. And you avoided it. What do you care, if I was just a cover? Well, who said you were just a cover? - Wasn't I? - Well, wasn't I? I have to- Excuse me. No exits up there, Jane. Be cold, John. She's a liar. Be super cold. Come on, honey! This way! - Do you know that you're ticking? Get back! Get back! Get back! - Limo, sir? Jane Smith. That's the second time you tried to kill me. Oh, come on. It was just a little bomb. I want you to know. I'm goin' home, and I'm gonna burn everything I ever bought you. - I'll race you there, baby. - You there yet? The first time we met, what was your first thought? You tell me. I thought- I thought you looked like Christmas morning. I don't know how else to say it. And why are you telling me this now? I guess, in the end, you start thinkin' about the beginning. So there it is. I thought you should know. So how about it, Jane? Hmm? I thought- I thought that you were the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen. - So it was all business, yeah? - All business. - From the go. - Cold, hard math. Thank you. That's what I needed to know. - Okay. - Okay. - Hey, John. Hey, Bill. - Uh, are you all right? - Yeah. - Okay. Uh, by the way, uh, John, your car is hangin' out over the, uh, sidewalk here. - Yeah. Thanks, Bill. - Okay. Have a good night. Good night. Shit. You still alive, baby? Your aim's as bad as your cookin', sweetheart. - Yeah. And that's saying something. - Come on, honey. Come to daddy. Who's your daddy now? I can't do it. Don't! Come on! Come on! You want it? It's yours. Oh, I can't- Come on. Mmm. Hiya, stranger. Hiya back. - Yeah? - Is everything okay? We heard an awful ruckus. No. Everything's fine here. Yeah. It's great. So you guys are- You're fine? Yeah. Couldn't be better. Oh. Nice. You guys- But are- - Suzy. Martin. Officers. - Have a nice night. Looks like you're redecorating. It's very- Yeah. Shame about the teak. [John] That left of yours. A thing of beauty. - You take it well. - Thank you. - That vacation in Aspen- - Mm. You left early. Why? - Jean-Luc Gaspard. - Oh! God! Oh. - Yeah. - I wanted him. - Forget it. - Wow. You didn't hear me that night the chopper dropped me off for our anniversary dinner? - No. - No? Mm. Percussion grenades. I was partially deaf that night. - I'm slightly color blind. - Mm. - Retinal scarring. - I can't feel anything in these three fingers. - Three ribs. Broken eye socket. - Mm. Oh. - Perforated eardrum. Mm. - Mmm. You ever have trouble sleeping after? - Nope. - Yeah. Me neither. Go, go, go, go, go! Look out! Move. Shoes. I was given 48 hours to take you out. - Same. - Jesus. Where's the trust? What do you expect? Why do I get the girl gun? - Are you kiddin' me? - No. Thank you. Come on! They're outside! Colemans. Guy's had my barbecue set for months. I was never in the Peace Corps. What? No. I really liked that about you. - Well, maybe this honesty thing isn't such a good idea. - No, no, no. - I didn't go to M.I.T. - Really? Notre Dame. Art history major. - Art? - History. - It's reputable. - Okay. Fuckers get younger every year. I have to tell you. I never really liked your cooking. - It's not your gift. - Hmm. Baby, I've never cooked a day in my life. L-Temp girls cooked. - Web of lies! I like it. Deal with it. - We got company. - What? Shit. - Baby, hold steady. Now! - It's called evasive driving, sweetheart. Hold still! This thing's all over the place. How do you drive these things anyways? Honey! - Transmission's terrible. - Honey, let me drive. - I got it. Move over. Move. I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart. - You move. - Fine. Go. - Go. - Go. - Go! - Go! They're bulletproof. They're bulletproof. You know, honey, I should probably tell you. I was married once before. - Are you out of your mind? What is wrong with you? - You're what's wrong with me. - It was a drunken Vegas thing! - Oh, that's better! - Stop it. - That's much better. That's great. Stop it. Go, go, go! [Groans] - What's her name and Social Security number? No. You're not gonna kill her. These doors are handy. You know, sweetheart, you're being a bit hypocritical. It's not like you're some beacon of truth. John, my parents- They died when I was five. I'm an orphan. Who-Who was that kindly fella who gave you away at our wedding? Paid actor. - I said- I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island! - I know. You know, I don't even want to talk about it. - You got it? - Got it. - Any time. - I got 'em. We're gonna have to redo every conversation we've ever had. I'm Jewish. [John] I can't believe I brought my real parents to our wedding. Disgusting. How could you serve this to someone? Excuse me, ma'am. Is it possible to get this reheated? Miss? - Miss, I'm talkin' to you. Excuse me. - [Taps Table] - Jesus, Johnny. - Good morning, Eddie. Morning. It's good to see you're okay, man. Tell me you got smart and that you killed that lyin' bitch. Hmm. This lying bitch? Guess it was just wishful thinking. - I'm sorry. - [John] Eddie, we got- - It's nice to see you, Jane. - Eddie. Eddie, focus, please. - We got problems. - You got problems? Crack addicts got problems, my friend. You two are smoked. - Maybe. - Maybe? John, you got the entire agency gunnin' for ya. - Probably have her agency gunnin' for you too. - What about you? - Me? - Where are you at? Where am I at? I find myself dragging my feet this morning. I think you owe me a little money anyway. - What do you think? - We don't understand each other. And I understand that. But I don't need those looks from you. I've been in his life a long time. - Eddie, Eddie. Focus. Focus. - I've been in his life for a long time. I'm pissed off. They blew up my house. They shot at my wife. My own company. If she works for who the street... says that she works for... you're Macy's and Gimbel's. She would be the WE channel, and you would be... whatever channel it is that competes against the WE channel. - Know what I'm saying? You following me? - Mm-hmm. Johnny, the point is simple. Once you guys decide to get off the reservation, that's it. - Then you're off the reservation. - Eddie, how bad? - How bad is it? - Mm. You remember Canada. - Ooh. - That was kid stuff next to what you're up against. - That was you? - Oh, is that a turn-on? - She tried to kill you with a car. Not my business. - Stop. A good friend stays out of it. I understand. This is the facts. If you two separate from each other, you got a shot. Not a great shot, Johnny, but you got a shot. You two stay together, you're dead. Unless you can find something that they want more than they want you. Found him. He's being held in subbasement "D" of the federal courthouse. High security. Motion and thermal. Power's on a city grid. This is as far as we go, Jane. Right. Thanks for everything. - Good luck, babe. We have this northwesterly flow... coming down through the middle of the country. So we're seeing successive areas- Do one of you guys mind changing the channel? - One is moving in right now. - Nick. Would you please get off your fat ass and change the channel? I know. It's tough. Thank you. That's going to make things even colder than they are right now. Now, 52- You guys go. [Jane] Thirty-second window. I cut the power, you grab the kid. - Simple and clean. Got it? - Got it. So tell me. How many? Does it matter? - Should I go first? - Okay. - I don't exactly keep count, but- I would say... - high 50s, low 60s. - Mm-hmm. Been around the block, but... - you know, the important thing is- - 312. 312? - How? - Some were two at a time. - Honey. - I'm- I'm- I'm- Baby's in the crib. Are you counting innocent bystanders? - Monitoring the perimeter? - I checked the perimeter. - What about the police bands? - I am on the police bands. - Connected to the main- - This is not my first time. I think we've established that. All right. Turn left. Left, John. Left! You don't have to talk to me like that. Okay? - Be nice. - Left, please? I can't go left. You see? There is no left. Look. I have straight. I have back the way I came. There's no left. Which way do you want me to go? - Just stay there and wait for my mark. - See what I'm sitting in? See that? - Take your time. - Yeah. All right. Stay. Stay there. Wait for my mark. I'll find it. Wait for my mark. Almost there. I don't know what happened. Just hold on. What are you-John, what are you doing? What are you doing? Kill the lights on my signal. Now. Kill the lights. Jane, kill the lights. - Hey. Who's that? - Where? [John] No, no. Not now! Turn 'em back on! - Idiot! - Idiot! - Here they come. - Hey, Nick. Uncuff me. Turn 'em on! Turn 'em back on! - Turn 'em back on! - Turn it back on. - All right. - Give me light. - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. - Nick. - Shut up. Give me a gun. - Nick, give me a gun. - Zip it! Open the door. Open the door. Back there. Look out. Move, move, move. [Groans] This guy's a wily one. Shut the door. Move. Move. The other way. How's this work? - I told you to wait for my signal. - You didn't wait for my signal. - Well, I improvised. - You deviated from the plan. - The plan was flawed. - The plan was not flawed. - Anal. - Organized. - Jane, 90% of this job is instinct. Your instincts set off every alarm in the building. My instincts got the job done. May not have been the Jane show. No. It was the John show. It was half-assed. Like Christmas. Like our anniversary. Like the time you forgot to bring my mother's birthday present. - Your fake mother's birthday. - The point is, you are always the first to break team. You don't want a team. You- You want a servant for hire. I want someone I can count on. - Jane, there's no air around you anymore. - Oh. Okay. What is that supposed to mean? It means there's no room for mistakes. No mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity. I mean, who can answer to that? Well, you don't have to. Do you? 'Cause this isn't even a real marriage. - Who are you people? - Shut up! Well. So, now I realize... you witnessed the missus and I working through some domestic issues. - Oh. - That's regrettable. But don't take that as a sign of weakness. That would be a mistake on your part. Now tell us what you know. Why do both our bosses want you dead? - You unders- Honey, please. Wrap it up. Maybe it's not such a good idea to undermine me in front of the hostage. Sends a mixed message. Sorry. Girls. - Okay. - Where was I? - "A mistake on your part." Shut up. Options. I'm gonna lay out your options for you. - Okay? Option "A." - If I could- Shut up. Option "A." You talk. We listen. No pain. Option "B." You don't talk. I remove your thumbs with my pliers. It will hurt. Option "C." I like to vary the details a bit, but the punch line is you die. - Benjamin. - Okay. - We're impatient people. - Okay. Can I get a soda? Or a juice or, uh, some- - "A." "A." Option "A." Aaah! - Oh, that hurt. - Okay. That was a nice shot. - What's-You got a spasm? I'm tied up. Why don't you check my back pocket? I'm not the target. You are. Both of you. They found out you're married... so they teamed up and sent you to the same hit to target each other. It was a joint task force by both your companies. Two competing agents living under the same roof. It's bad for business. - They wanted you to take each other out. - You were bait. Well, it's entry level. Toehold into the company. Couple hits, they bump me up to a desk. It's pretty cool actually. You keep the photo in your back pocket? - What was I supposed to do? Frame it? - You get rid of it. You burn it. - Tradecraft 101. - I'm sorry. I guess I skipped that day. Just like I guess you skipped the day about not marrying the enemy. You were bait, or you are bait? Belt. Belt. Belt, dude. Two minutes. One minute. I'll get you closer. A little help. - Clear. - Clear. Hey, I think I chipped my tooth. Do you know if we have dental? My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz. Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what? So, at least, apart, we know what the odds are. Let's just call this what it is... and what it isn't. All right. So it's a crap marriage. All right. I'm a mess. You're a disaster. We're both liars. But you run, you'll always be running. I say we stay and we fight. We finish this thing. Then if you wanna go, you can go. Oh, thank you. What? "Let's call this what it is." Jesus Christ. - Stop. - Don't. Oh, Jesus. This is a really good store. - See you in the next life, Jane. - Likewise, John. Sorry. We'll talk about this later. Jesus! - I didn't touch a thing. - Yes, you did. - Sorry about the, uh, knife in- - I don't want to talk about it. - I'll fly. - I'll be bait. - I'm goin' clockwise, so watch my 6:00. - All right. Go! Move! How's it look? It's a piece of cake. Watch these. They tend to jam. So watch 'em. You favor your left, sweetheart, so look out for right. Damn. That boat in La Paz is lookin' pretty good right now, isn't it? Well, it rains a lot this time of year. Shut up. I'm interested in the progress you've made in the last few weeks. Uh, doin' all right, aren't we? I mean, listen. I'm not gonna lie to you. There were times I just wanted to- - Kill her, but, uh- - Likewise. Couldn't take the shot. - That's a good sign. - Who would've thought. - Sometimes you have to battle through. - Hmm. - That's marriage, right? - Yeah. You take your best shot and- - Oh. We redid the house. - Hmm. We did. Yes, we did. - You know, there will always be challenges. - Uh-huh. - Threats out there. - Yep. But you can handle it together. - So far. - Yes, we ca- So far? Oh, what is that? I'm leaving room for the unknown. So far. And do you feel that your relationship styles... - are more conducive to the free flow- - Ask us the sex question. John. - Uh, well, that- Ten.
