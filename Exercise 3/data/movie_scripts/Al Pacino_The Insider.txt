I know what I have to know. it stays that way. I still do the tough stories. 60 Minutes reaches a lot of people. Let me see the documents. This is a, um, because it's from another company. This issue is a drop in the bucket. Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman? Did work. - Did work? - How much would I get paid? If you want to do it. I worked as a, uh, Tobacco company. Mr. Bergman. [Door Closes] [Wallace On Television] President Assad of Syria said... that difficult obstacles remain, but that his country, - [ Static ] - That's a Peabody, Mike. [Chattering] - [ Chuckles ] Come on. - Debbie! -[Man]Hey, Lowell. -You want it for the news? -What about you? You got a crew already? - Debbie. - How are you? Kentucky state law about-- Tony. [ Vacuum Whirring ] [Whirring Continues] [Man] Mr. Wigand? You can go up now. [Quiet Chattering] from the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation. - Seven. - And he gets out there... and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. I don't like being back here. One of the reasons I was a great salesman... I knew that if I ever broke my promise, I'd suffer the consequence. Is that a threat? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... [ Chuckles ] Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff. About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences, but-- Research. You declare [ Scoffs ] Okay. I don't believe that you can maintain corporate integrity... without confidentiality agreements. the health and welfare benefits are good, so we've drafted a supplement to your agreement. what is confidential. I didn't know that was a secret." We'd like you to sign it. And if I don't? If we arrive at the conclusion that you're acting in bad faith, and you'll sign it. Now you question my integrity? Fuck me? Well, fuck you! I'm not sure he got the message. Oh, I think he did. [ Horn Honking ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Chuckles ] - Yeah. - You fucked me! - Who's this? - Protect your sources? You screwed me. You sold me out. [ Sighs ] [Ball Clanging] [Ball Clattering] [Ball Clanging] [ Exhales Deeply] [Hits Ball] [Vocalizing] [ Breathing Deeply] [ Engine Starts ] Stay away from me. You stay away from me! I did not give you up to anyone. - What business do we have? Right here, right now. How the hell do I know about Brown &Williamson? - No, I did not. I don't burn people. [Engine Starts] Ride with me while I take the girls to school. Deborah, my oldest daughter. I will sign it. Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement. - Like what? Johnson &Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related. What else outside the zone? When he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, He didn't even wait for the F.D.A. to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol... [ Chuckles ] And then he developed a safety cap. Because as a C.E.O., sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. Not like the Seven Dwarfs. - Seven Dwarfs? - Seven C.E.O.s of Big Tobacco. It was on C-SPAN. Yeah. market and sell enormous volume, go to a lot of golf tournaments. Could have been beneficial. Mostly, I got paid a lot. I mean, what the hell is wrong with that? Because look, here's how it lays out. [ Engine Starts ] - [Man]Congressman, definitions of addiction. - There is no intoxication. - [ Congressman ] We'll take that as no. I believe that nicotine is not addictive. I too believe that nicotine-- He referred to this-- the Seven Dwarfs-- - What Seven Dwarfs? - What's this? - What that is is tobacco's standard defense. It's the "we don't know" litany. Addiction? We believe not. Disease? We don't know. We take a bunch of leaves, we roll them together, you smoke 'em. So, that tells me nothing. in the number-three tobacco company in America. He's got something to say. He wants to say it. I want it on 60 Minutes. - Doesn't matter what he wants. -[Wallace] Am I missing something here? -What do you mean, Mike? -He's got a corporate secrecy agreement. Give me a break. Issues like that. He can talk, we can air it. The unlimited checkbook. That's how Big Tobacco wins... Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis. Listen, G.M. and Ford, they get nailed... -These clowns have never-- I mean ever-- -[Man]Not even once. Not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness... What do you mean? [ Chuckles ] What do you mean, "compelled"? State courts. Be a witness. - What does that do? - What do you mean, what does it do? What I mean is like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement? Because he has to, uh, reveal it in a court of law. It's on record. It's out. It's no secret anymore. Yeah, but what venue? And where does he get-- Does he have killer attorneys? I don't think he's got any attorneys. and millions of dollars of their own dough in legal costs. will he go for it? [ Clears Throat ] I'm trying to start a new career. I believe I could be a good teacher. That's it. It's where our babies were born. In the grass. Come on. Come on. We can make this work for us. Okay? It's just-- It's not-- Simpler, easier. More time. More time together. More time with the kids. More time for us. Okay? It's just-- This is gonna be better. This is gonna be better.

I mean-- I don't know what the fuck I really think. - I don't fuckin' know. -Jeffrey, describe for me... in detail what happened. Well-- No. Look, I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. - You called me. - So, what about? Okay. Hello? Are you there? Yeah. Look, um-- - I didn't know. - It's okay. [Phone Ringing] - Lowell. - [ Static On Phone Line ] Who is this? Do not call here! Do not-- [ Dial Tone ] [ Wigand Speaking Japanese ] [ Waitress Speaking Japanese ] [Japanese ] What are you gonna get us? - Marcus-- - Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. And on me, personally. I, uh-- [ Clears Throat ] You charge by the hour? You understand? I drink. - Um-hmm. Pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. [ Clears Throat ] and I don't like to be pushed around. I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? - You believe that? - No. You should. Because when you're done the judgment... And that's... the power you have. - You believe that? - I believe that? - Yes, I believe that. - You believe that... - Yes. to justify having a good job. Having status. [ Both Talking At Once ] or 60 Minutes with this cheap skepticism. I've been out in the world givin' my word... I said I'd call the kids before they went to bed. [Japanese ] - What's with all the horses? This is Richard Scruggs. [Radio: Indistinct] - Area code 21 2-555-01 99. - I'll call you then. - I don't know. - [Phone Ringing] Richard Scruggs. research at Brown & Williamson. Former corporate officer there. Has he decided to go public? It would be better if he called us. Get me, uh-- Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!. [Man On Radio: Indistinct] [Girl] What are you cooking? [Beeping] [Beeping Continues] [ Beeping Continues ] [Clicks Mouse, Beeping Stops] Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Uniforms arrived on the scene, found this white male subject shot to death. [Phone Beeps] Yes, I'm afraid I did. We won't be able to lift usable prints. What caliber is my gun? Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun? What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? [ Crying ] If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand. Why do you keep this gun? I don't think it's unconstitutional yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter. That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38? Yeah. Yes, I do. [ Coughing ] You all right? [Dog Barking] We need to take a look At your gun safe, Mr. Wigand. Now who are they trying to protect? pissed off and curious! as we fuckin' speak! I'll give it a look. - How are the rooms? Comfortable? - Yes, very. Taping? An interview? I thought we-- I'm sorry. Liane, this is a preliminary-- You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for? Talk about it, think about it. I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it, Oh, man. Who are these people? [ Crew Chattering ] [ Wallace ] You heard Mr. Sandefur say... I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself... because I watched those testimonies very carefully. [Wallace] All of us did. I mean, there was this whole line of people, whole line of C.E.O. 's up there swearing. Part of the reason I'm here is that I felt... at least within Brown & Williamson's representation-- We are in the nicotine delivery business. And that's what cigarettes are for. Delivery device for nicotine. While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There is extensive use of this technology, known as ammonia chemistry. It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung... and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system. The straw that broke the camel's was a compound called coumarin. When I came on board at B&W, that it would effect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience... continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew-- we had documentation-- was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen. I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute. [Wallace]In other words, you are charging Sandefur... and Brown & Williamson... Thomas Sandefur, C.E.O. of Brown &Williamson, had you fired. And there a son he gave you? Poor communication skills. Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel com-- compelled to do it. If you'd asked me... Yeah, I think it's worth it. [ Chattering ] [ Chattering Subsides ] - Hi. - [ Students ] Hi. My name is Jeff Wigand. You can call me, uh, Mr. Wigand. You can call me Dr. Wigand. You can call me Jeff. I find it an adventure. He's on line three. [ Students Chattering ] - Hello? - Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand. When should we do this? You've got your own security now. You know, Lowell, I can't-- I can't afford to-- There'll be three of us on the detail. Uh, I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi. - I heard. [Beeping] - Uh, coffee, Lowell? - Yeah, all right. Where should I wash them? Use the bathroom. What's the difference? That's for food. [Turns Off Water] Leave it on. Just leave it on! Okay? I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry. Can we talk about this when I get back? Yes, Jeffrey. Jeff!. You've been served. Now, what this one is is a temporary restraining order, - Right. - Now, but the judge threw it out. And you ought to know that. That's right. How does-- How does one go to jail? Wh-What does my family do? Go on welfare? Put food on the table? I mean, my children need me. Dr. Wigand, listen. As I understand from Dick, you're our key witness, And I think I know how you're feeling. In combat, events have a duration of seconds. Sometimes minutes. Week in, week out. Month after month after month. You're assaulted psychologically. You're assaulted financially, directed at your kids. What school can you afford? How will that affect their lives? You're asking yourself, "Will that limit what they may become?" held hostage. I do know how it is. You attract a crowd. Yeah. Great. I heard about the Kentucky gag order. I don't know what to do. [ Reporters Chattering ] [ Reporters Shouting Questions ] [ Crowd Chattering, Laughing ] Hold on a second. [Man On Police Radio.: Indistinct] I can't seem to find the criteria to decide. Maybe things have changed. A lot's changed. You mean since this morning? No, I mean since whenever. Fuck it. Let's go to court. [ No Audio ] [ Reporters Shouting Questions ] [ Chattering ] [ Chattering Subsides ] I want to start as fast as possible. Please stand. Raise your right hand. Jeffrey S. Wigand. R-E-Y. W-l-G-A-N-D. No, I don't have a clue. - That is correct. - In other words, it acts as a drug, Your objection's been recorded. I am instructing you... not to answer that question. In accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations... under taken by you... not to disclose any information... And in accordance with the force and effect... that has been entered against you... That means you don't talk. Mr. Motley, we have rights here. Oh, you've got rights. And lefts. Ups and downs and middles. This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina, nor Kentucky. Wipe that smirk off your face! Answer the question, Doctor. Um, nicotine is associated with... impact, satisfaction. [Vocalizing] One of the reasons I'm here is that I felt... Then back on Jeff... Hell of a show, Mike. Explosive material. of Kools to the world. [ Laughing ] - I like that. - [Hewitt] Corporate has some questions. - When's the air date? - Lowell, Sharon's online three. - Tell her I'll call her back in ten. - [Editor]Here we go. Brown &Williamson's chief executive officer, Thomas Sandefur. I believe that nicotine is not addictive. I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself... because I watched those testimonies very carefully. [ Wallace ] All of us did. There was this whole line of people, whole line of C.E.O.'s up there all swearing. We are in the nicotine delivery business. There is extensive use of this technology, known as ammonia chemistry. It allows for the nicotine tobe more rapidly absorbed in the lung... and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system. - [ Wallace ] You're going to get your fix. [Vocalizing] [Dog Barking] - Shall I send for coffee? because there's a legal concept... Tortious interference. Hence, tortious interference. And after we corroborate it. is exact and precise. And I don't think it would hurt to make sure you're right on this one. [Hewitt] Why? You think we have liability? What's the CBS News position, Eric? But one we have to check on, Mike. I've retained outside counsel to do exactly that... What does that mean? " Rife with--" And I'm told there are questions as to our star witness' veracity. Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard for everybody else. Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, If he lied, he didn't disclose their information, and the damages are smaller. - Is this Alice in Wonderland? - You said "on this one." What about this one? But if it did and we aired this segment, and CBS was sued by Brown &Williamson, I think we could be at grave risk. because of your segment, the Brown &Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen. "Tortious interference." That sounds like a disease caught by a radio. -[Hewitt]Lunch? - Sure. [Dialing Phone] Debbie, it's me. I want you to check some filings, and give me John Wilson's number at Bear-Stearn. [Man] Hello, Lowell, Mike. -[Door Closes] - Don. I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview. I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview. have it in the can. - No, I'm not. Since when has the, uh, [Hewitt] It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? Before you go, I discovered this. - What? - Yeah, I heard rumors. It's not a rumor. It's a sale. If Tisch can unload CBS... for $81 a share to Westinghouse, and then is suddenly threatened... with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit from Brown &Williamson, Uh, " More vested interests. Persons who will profit from this merger. " Mr. Eric Kluster, president of CBS News, 1 .4 million." You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." -[Hewitt] You're exaggerating. - I am? I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. maybe the biggest, most expensive... Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets. [Hewitt] You are a fanatic, an anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. What are you? Are you a businessman or are you a newsman? - Lowell-- What? I'm with Don on this. [Door Opens, Closes] What's wrong? - What? I'm alone on this. [Phone Ringing] It's Jeffrey Wigand. Jeffrey. How are you? Uh, Liane has filed for divorce. And, so, I've moved out. I checked into room 930. Odd choice, huh? I don't know how to say this, - What? - B&W may have threatened litigation. CBS is on the block. - But you, I mean-- I know how you-- - No. No, what? Jeff. Mrs. Wigand? All right. Um, seven months after we were married, we found out that I had multiple sclerosis. [Man] And you had a daughter, Diane-- [Man #2] Tommy Sandefur told me himself. to the American public. [ Man On TV] First wife and estrangement of daughter. He's a shoplifter. He's a convicted shoplifter. What do you think I'm gonna do? Quit in protest? I'm not gonna do that. You're not? What are you doing? You don't like it? Hey, I tell you what? Fire my ass. I don't think so. Take a look at this. He wouldn't lie about his whole life. You backed the wrong horse. The version without the interview is gonna air the week after next. What was that about? - Get me Wigand. - Sure. What the fuck is this? Fuck! with one hand tied behind my back... I was young! I was young! Confused. We didn't handle it the right way. - What? - Some public relations guy... What kind of shit is this? l-- I was-- I was not on the team. I sparred with the Olympic team. - ABC-- - ABC Telemarketing Company. The can opener! A 39.95 can opener! You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes? with my testimony? with my testimony? - I told the truth! Hello? I told the truth. I told the truth. I am trying to protect you, man. [Dialing Phone] [Woman] - Hello? - It's Lowell. You bet we are, and I can't talk to you now. [Phone Beeps] [Siren Wailing] He's dead unless I can get this thing knocked down. Make it even a little more attractive. - What's the deadline? - Soon. [ Crowd Chattering ] - Hey. How are you? Hey, listen. - Hey. - Push it. - What? Forget it. - It's drawn from Well, it's authoritive... and overwhelmingly documented. And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you gonna put... Are you all right? Yeah. [ Woman ] Officer Muravchick? Thank you. Officer Muravchick, how are you? - I'm Sandra Sutherland. - How do you do? Mind if I sit down? Your Honor, could I have a word with you? You presided in a dispute over support payments. CBS is under criticism because the CBS News program, 60 Minutes, will not be presenting an interview-- What the hell are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing. No! I should have. Okay? Take a vacation. Now! [Phone Ringing] Lowell? Look, I've decided to preface Sunday's show. I did three minutes on the Evening News. You'll want to see it. in lieu of being fired. I took off on Tisch. I took off on Corporate. I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air? Do me a favor, will you? Spare me. That decision I've already made. Is there information that people should have... - Yes. defended the network's decision not to broadcast... - Where's the rest? - [ Woman On TV] Dan. Where the hell's the rest? - [Dan]Nebraska football fans voiced their criticism-- - You cut it! Time? Bullshit! You corporate lackey. Mike. Mike. Mike. " Mike"? Mike! Try " Mr. Wallace." Here. These are their leads, their sources. Have them make their own calls. Push the deadline, Charlie. Mmm, he's into kind of little cars that, um-- [Man On TV] The 63-36 vote was three shy of the two-thirds needed to pass-- - Mom. There's Dad. - Yes? - On the TV. - [Man On TV]...dating back to 1986. The most recent trouble for Wigand occurred here-- And in local news, WLKO, Louisville, on former Brown & Williamson research head, Jeffrey Wigand, at the DuPont Manual High School. Maria. [Ticking] [Wallace] Thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry... have surfaced over the past year. Documents that appear to confirm... what a former U.S. surgeon general... and the current head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying. We learned of a tobacco insider who could tell us... That insider was formerly... But we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco, if we were to broadcast an interview with him, CBS could be faced with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit. The fact is, we are not allowed even to mention his name... And, of course, we cannot show you his face. - Is still in force? - [ Voice Over] Yes, it is. [Voice Over] I would be tonight. [Wallace] The former executive has reason to be ton being sued, [ Phone Beeping ] [ Wallace ] You disappeared on me. I think it was a disgrace. [ Dial Tone ] [Dialing Phone] [Phone Ringing] [Vocalizing] - [ Man ] Still no answer. - Get me the manager's office. I'm concerned for a friend of mine who's staying at your hotel right now. Mr. Wigand? Mr. Wigand? Did he hear you? What about now? - What? - Hello? Can you hear me now? [Continues] in these words: Get on the fucking phone. I-l can't say that.

I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself... - because I watched those There was this whole line of people, whole line of C.E.O.'s up there all swearing.
