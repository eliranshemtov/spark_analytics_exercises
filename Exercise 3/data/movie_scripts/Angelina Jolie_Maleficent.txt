<font color="#808080">NARRATOR:</font> Let us tell an old story anew, and we will see how well you know it. Once upon a time, there were two kingdoms that were the worst of neighbours. So vast was the discord between them that it was said only a great hero or a terrible villain might bring them together. In one kingdom lived folk like you and me, with a vain and greedy king to rule over them. They were forever discontent, and envious of the wealth and beauty of their neighbours. For in the other kingdom, the Moors, lived every manner of strange and wonderful creature. And they needed neither king nor queen, but trusted in one another. In a great tree on a great cliff in the Moors lived one such spirit. You might take her for a girl, but she was not just any girl. She was a fairy. <font color="#D900D9">(BRANCH CRACKS)</font> <font color="#D900D9">(GASPS)</font> There you go. And her name was Maleficent.

Mine, too. We'll see each other again. You really shouldn't come back here, you know. It's not safe. And if I made that choice, if I came back, would you be here? Perhaps. - Ow! - What's wrong? Your ring. Iron burns fairies. I'm sorry. I like your wings. <font color="#808080">NARRATOR:</font> Maleficent thought of how Stefan cast away his ring, he who had so little in the world, so that their hands might touch again, and her heart was moved. Thus did the young thief who had hoped to steal a jewel... <font color="#808080">STEFAN:</font> Maleficent! ...steal something far more precious. <font color="#808080">STEFAN:</font> Maleficent?

And for a time it seemed as if, in them at least, the old hatred between men and fairies had been forgotten. As it will, friendship slowly turned into something else. And on her 16th birthday, Stefan gave Maleficent a gift. He told her it was true love's kiss. But it was not to be. As the years passed, Stefan's ambition pulled him away from Maleficent, and towards the temptations of the human kingdom. While Maleficent, the strongest of the fairies, rose to become the protector of the Moors. Maleficent often wandered alone and sometimes wondered where Stefan might be, for she had never understood the greed and envy of men. But she was to learn. For the human king had heard of a growing power in the Moors, and he sought to strike it down. <font color="#808080">SOLDIER:</font> Guard, halt! Guard, halt!

The wheels were broken and burned, that they might never be used, and thrown into the deepest dungeon in the castle. Secretly, he entrusted the safety of the child to the magic of the pixies, who would take her to a remote hideaway for 16 years and a day. Stefan shut himself behind the walls of his castle while his soldiers rode far and wide to hunt Maleficent down. But she made walls of her own, that the Moors might never again suffer the touch of any human.

It's that way. The castle. What's your name? It's Philip. Hello, Philip. What's yours? Aurora. Hello, Aurora. Well, it was nice meeting you. And once again, my apologies for being such a clumsy fool. You're forgiven. That's good. I'd best be off, then. Good bye. Will you be back this way? Nothing could stop me. Then I'll see you soon. Very soon. <font color="#D900D9">(HORSE NEIGHING)</font> - Goodbye, Philip. - Goodbye, for now. <font color="#D900D9">(CAWING)</font> Stop doing that. Well? That boy's the answer. <font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHING)</font> - No, Diaval. - Yes! True love's kiss, remember? It can break the spell. True love's kiss? Have you not worked it out yet? I cursed her that way because there is no such thing. Well, that might be how you feel, but what about Aurora? <font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font> That boy could be her only chance. It's her fate, anyway. Go ahead. Turn me into whatever you want. A bird, a worm. I don't care any more. I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow. We are not leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday. <font color="#808080">KNOTGRASS:</font> And Stefan told us to take her back the day after her birthday. No. He said on her birthday. <font color="#808080">KNOTGRASS:</font> No. The day after her birthday. - On. - After. - On. - After. - On, on, on! - After, after, after!

We are taking you back to your father with... My father? You told me my parents were dead. I think you better come and sit down. Fairy Godmother! I'm here. When were you going to tell me that I'm cursed? Is it true? It is. My aunts said it was an evil fairy. I... I can't remember her name. They said it was... Maleficent. Is that you? Are you Maleficent? No! Don't touch me. You're the evil that's in the world.

She claims to be the princess. Father. It's me, Aurora! You look just like your mother. They brought you back a day too soon. I told those three idiots! Lock her up in her room. Go. Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming. <font color="#808080">FLITTLE:</font> It's so good to be small again! Look at my feet! I love my tiny little feet! Pay attention!
