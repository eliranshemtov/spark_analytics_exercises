Yeah. Shit. Where is he? Gotta go. What's the latest? Nothing, they say the first 24 hours... Did she understand? It's not their fight. Did she understand? It's not their fight. Where are Tess and Isabel? It's not their fight. Any change? He's in critical condition, but he's still alive. - You know, if he doesn't... - Is Stan there? - Yeah, he's been there an hour. - Stan'll us what's going on. cardio infarction. He's endured an incredible shock to his system. - Can he recover? - Yes. Will he recover? It helps if they have something to live for. Family. Friends then. Maybe that'll be enough. Reuben, when it comes to Willie Bank you can't rely on contracts. My lawyers say... the ironclad. Gimme some credit for my business. But you'll still think it's a good idea neither does Rusty? Well, I'm doing it. It's done. And you tell Rusty that I won't have to pull jobs... to keep my hotel solvent. Hey, Reuben... You fellows are young. You don't understand. Did you know that the Inuit people... put their elders out on a ice foe to die... when they're too old to hunt? - Thanks. - That's just a myth. Well that ain't gonna happen to me. I can still hunt. This is it. It's my chance. I used to mean something in this town. I would walk into a restaurant... if it was full, they'd snap out a new table for me... like that. Listen Reuben, if you're worried about your place in history... then let us get a street named after you... or a boulevard. We can talk about that when I'm dead. Danny, I appreciate you coming this far to see me... but I gotta do this. Reuben! - Partner! - Reuben! So good of you to come. Of course. Of course. I get more items for my punch list... I got so much energy, I can... hardly sleep from the excitement. Where are you at on the visas for the chefs? My man in Washington says... they'll be stamped by the time we open. - No, no, no, not good enough. - That's what I said. That's good. And the chandeliers? My ex-wife's new brother-in-law... You don't need the details. It's done. Half priced. They're already at the warehouse. And because I know it mattered to you... I appeared before the City Council. The one-way street leading away... from the rear entrance, now... leads toward the rear entrance. All roads lead to the "Midas". This is perfect. Great views up here. Where's the partner's desk gonna be? No partner's desk. - Two desks. - No two desks, one desk. One chairman's desk. One. The arrangement is changing. Was changed. As a matter of fact there is no arrangement. Everybody said that you would try to screw me. But you've done it to everyone of your partners. But I defended you. I said: No, me and Willie Bank been around long enough... that we both shook Sinatra's hand. And there's a code amongst guys that shook Sinatra's hand. Screw Sinatra's hand. - Screw? - You're deadweight. Do you think I'm gonna carry you and pay you at the same time? Reuben... you're out. Never. This is my land. Was. Was your land. - You signed it over to the corporation. - For 50% interest. Which I'm gonna ask you to sign over to me. For a small cash payment. - I'm not signing that. - Yes. Get outta here. I'm not signing that. What are you gonna do? Throw me of the roof? No, I don't want to. This is wrong. This is all wrong. You're leaving me with nothing. You know you're right. And it's rude. Here. It's the first badge. Just got made. You changed the name. I like it better. Don't you? Reuben... he always was too trusted. Is Saul. Is. Of course. Is. He tried talking him out of it next time. Look, Bank hurt Reuben... I know how that makes me feel. - I know what that makes me wanna do. - Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get close to Bank and I don't care if it gets messy. I'll drive you... and get him leaving his barber. Good, then I'll inject him. Yeah and I'll find a spot to get rid of the body. All valid ideas. Great initiative. But... But... Even though Bank stepped over the line... we have to do what's best for Reuben. Which means we offer Bank... a "Billy Martin". Wait a minute? And then what, he goes for it? And that's it, he gets off? - That's the rule. - No, that's the rules... for someone who understands the rules. which Bank don't, because he already broke them. So he don't get the chance. For Reuben... I think we give him a chance. I need answers before I ask questions. You get that? Alright. Do it! So... some guys I take seriously... tell me you're a serious guy. Right. What I want... what's most important to be is that Reuben gets his share of the hotel restored. I'm here to give you a chance to do that. You're gonna give me a chance? Okay. It's a Billy Martin? I pass. Last time I looked and I look every morning... it was my name listed as owner on more valuable property... in this state than anyone else in history. Which means you gotta lot more to lose. Well I don't lose. People who bet on me to lose, lose... and they lose big. You come at me you better know... I move quick and when I do... I slice... like a goddamn hammer. So you're not gonna make Rueben? If Reuben was too weak or too stupid... to see what was coming down... then you know what? He didn't belong here. He's made the right choice: roll over and die. Let him be. How long do I have to wait for a conduit? I don't want the labor pains I just want the baby. Six months later. Well... thanks for coming. Thanks for the 100 Grant. This takes longer than a day though. Gonna have to re-negotiate. That's fair. I'd like some Sen Cha or Genmaicha. Green tea. Yes, sir. And don't burn it. Pour it just before boiling point... - not after. - Green Tea. Si signore. Graci. Just us three? - For now... - Figured we talk to you first.. Good lord. How stuck I am? Stuck. Stalled really. Stuck. Run it from me. Don't leave anything out. Give me the big picture. - You wanna? - It's all yours. - Where shall we start? - Start with the hotel. Bank really put on this one. Forget weekenders and conventioneers. He's built this place for the whales. of a Five Diamond Award. The marble was handpicked in Italy... and the chefs stolen from the highest rated restaurants on the Michelin guidebook. In the villas big players the silverware is actually gold. Bank's greatest strength is also his weakness. Ego. He's been spending his days checking and rechecking every inch of the property... getting ready for the grand opening celebration. It's a compulsion. Bank's right-hand man is a woman. Abigail Sponder. We're gonna have to let you go. Turn in your uniform. I only gained 4 pounds. You can't. Yeah, well your body mass index is not what its supposed to be. - But miss Sponder... - Oh no, babydoll, it's your butt that's the problem. You can't find a waitress based on appearance, man. That's just unconstitutional. If they were waitresses. Yeah, they're actually hired as models who serve. So that Bank can monitor their physical appearance. It's a cruel practice. So between Bank and Sponder they got the place covered. - When is opening night? - July the 3rd. Got fireworks the stroke of midnight the whole charade. Are we going in now? It's already open. No, it's a soft opening. To test the place before the grand opening. Yeah it's kinda like an out of town preview... on the town. Soft opening? Grand opening? When they opened the Flamingo... one day it was closed the next day it was open. End of story. I know, I was there. Well it's different now. So when is opening night? July the 3rd. Now the top casinos can clear $3 million a day... just on the floor. Bank with his high level players... and no limits is projecting 5. Upon exchange for the loans he had to give up... six of the nine seats on the board. So he doesn't control his company. The guys he brought in aren't friendly. So he has to clear 500 million in the first quarter... or he gets dumped out of his own hotel. Bank wants another Five Diamond Award. Every hotel I ever... has one: a Royal Review Five Diamond Award. The Cigarou Inn: five diamonds. The Peloponnesian Monte Carlo: five diamonds. The Grand Saphir, Singapore: cinco diamantes. Atomano Crest, Tahiti... I never not won one. So, how are you gonna get the diamonds? - We're not. - We thought about it for a minute... - Then we decided... It was... - Impossible. - Tell him about Debbie. - Yeah, tell him about Debbie. Debbie is a concierge at the Bank. She's very ambitious. In a good way... for us. As soon as I said the words: general manager... she was in. I put a cherry on top to make sure. We found out who'd be reviewing the hotel. We're gonna get to him before Bank can. I feel bad. Like torture. This is war, kid. There's gonna be collateral damage. lar restul se va �nt�mpla at the airport. - No, he doesn't know that. - So what? He has to know why you won? You enjoy it? Who says? Alright so you go through that for 10 million? No. I do it for eleven mille. Now, we found out Bank is tapped into the federal fingerprint database. Highly illegal. We came up with a way to piggyback his system... in between firewall checks. Very interesting stuff out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what else? We're gonna get his whales. How? He talked to Denny Shields. Denny Shields? After he bragged about you guys into talking about how? We need him. I should have kept my mouth shut. And then I saw that guy walking around. I didn't know who he was. And I... Just some guy to me. - And I guess I pissed him off. - Denny, look... you know what you gotta know who he was. Just forget it. Let it go. The other stuff I got taken care of... is all straight. I got 18 whales, I spoke to their handlers, I spoke to their managers, I spoke to their assistants. Everyone of them is gonna. We're gonna do it in two. I'm gonna leave first they're gonna follow. - Okay. - Okay. But you gotta make sure they win because these guys usually lose. - And when they lose, they get. - They're gonna win big. - How big? - 500. - One million. - That night just a group of you No, it's a reverse Big Store. Right... - Doesn't matter if we win... - As long as the casino loses, yes... That could actually work. So you need to rig... Craps, Black Jack, roulette, slots. This polymer reacts to ultrasonic pulses... but it's not metallic, so the compasses on the table won't detect it... and it don't effect the way mark the dice. Now this... Not really a lighter? The dice are controlled from the manufacturer all the way to the floor. Which is why we went all the way to the manufacturer. Could the air conditioner be switched on? The air conditioner? You're crazy. Look... You know? It's dangerous. Dangerous, is my middle name. That's not your problem. So you're jammed on Black Jack. We've embedded Livingston in the Shuffle Company. Now the tap will stimulate your EKG much in the same way a lie would. But you have to step on it during the control questions. Your name, birth date, so on. So those levels will match the stress level with your false answers. I got it. How much is this gonna hurt? If you're doing it right, it should be pretty excruciating. Is your birth date February 11, 1965? Yes. Are you wearing a white shirt? Yes. Have you ever been involved in the commission of a crime? Oh, no. Have you ever defrauded or attempted to defraud the gaming industry? No. - Alex... - Solid. I love technology. - I guess to look at you I'd swear you would be evasive... - But? the machine says you're clean. I'm just a little nervous. I really want this job. You can relax now. Welcome to Shuffle Royal. The Shuffle Royal. I doubt I've heard the last of that one. So if Black Jack is not your problem... it must be slots. Progressors run of computer chips now. You're gonna have to program in a trapdoor. I can probably find you someone to do that. Thanks Roman, we got somebody in on the inside. A great kid named Eugene. Who's got a little too much downtime. He's run up a nice little online gaming tap. He won't be able to keep it a secret much longer. Now I have no... Uh yeah, it's crazed. How bad is it? Uh, it's bad... I owe $30,000. - So it may as well be a 100. - Alright. Let's call it a 100. Thanks Danny. Eugene. My pleasure. Now tell me how you're gonna program that trapdoor. So if that's not the problem, it must be roulette. Having it in that game is in for a scanner on the shoe... wired to a microcomputer somewhere on your person. It figures the probability where the wheels will end within 3 digits. Yeah, we-we tried that. No offense, the way he was dressed, didn't help. Not very subtle, this guy. - So you're stuck on roulette? - No. We're going lo-fi we think we can get some loaded balls in there. Kidding? How are you gonna deliver? Two stages. First we position a man of our own. There's a gaming Expo the day of the grand opening... which Bank is committed to attend. To show what a regular guy he is. Frank's suiting up as The Game. The men who make the decisions are very hard to impress. That's why I'm asking each and every one of you to help me so... by being the most classy, gentile... ladies. The image that we're looking for... are tasteful elegance. What exactly do you want us to do? Raise your skirts up about 3 inches. Second part. We tie Frank to one of theirs. A pit boss with sticky fingers. How much for these? Is Willie Bank know you're stealing his gold flatware, Neil? How do you know my name? Well we know a lotta names. Your wife, Mary... your kids, Leanne and Dolly. We know that you are the pit boss at the casino. You don't wanna... - I mean, I don't... - We don't wanna hurt you. We wanna help you. We wanna double your salary. All in one night. What do you need me to do? Right now, nothing. Go home, do your job. And at the appropriate moment somebody'll present himself to you. - Enough said? - Enough said. Who is the shill at the Expo to rope Bank? - We're still looking. - We'll find someone. Make sure it's somebody he really despises. Back to macro. What is your exit strategy? The players won't be on the scam... so they'll all think it's their lucky night. But you never get them out of the door with all their winnings... they'll dump it all back. That's Vegas and that's your problem. Well the exit strategy is A problem... it's not THE problem. The problem is security. We're drawing a blank. It's a little spooky. The specs aren't on the grey market, the black market... or any other market. And all I keep hearing, is there's never been a system like this. Now I've found out where they designed it, but I can't even get in the building. I've blown all my buy money, my bribe money... 4 of my best ideas and I am nowhere. But not only I'm nowhere, I'm pretty sure I'm being followed. Do you have anything? Yeah, I think I have a name, but I don't even know if it's right. - They're calling it... - The Greco. The Greco Player Tracker. They've put it in Vegas. - Well I give you back the 100 Grant. - Why? Danny, I like you. And you, Rusty. I mean you got style. You're brilliant, got loyalty. You 2 were remarkable minds of a thievery but even they went off to borrow. You're analogue players in a digital world. You're done. Believe me, I would love to go up against Greco... and crush him. But it can't be beaten. It can't be hacked... and it can't be beaten. Not even by you? Oh with 18 months... nothing else on my plate no other jobs, no women or distractions... maybe. - You know everything about this thing. - Everything. Except where it was being deployed. The inventor is an old schoolmate of mine. His name is Greco Montgomery The pompous ass named it after himself. Greco? Roman? Yeah, you've obviously never served time in a British boarding school. So what's so tough about this thing? It's an artificial intelligence security system. He must be field-testing. You mean it has a brain? A hell of a brain. It doesn't only think... it reasons. It reads every permutation in every weight in every seat in the entire casino. Hand by hand. That's why this security cameras that measure pupil dilation. And determine if a win is legitimate or expected. It gathers biofeedback... player's heart-rates, body temperatures... it measures on a second by second basis... whether the standard variations of gaming algorithm... are holding... or are being manipulated. The data is analyzed in real-time... in a field of exabytes. Exabytes? - You know what a terabyte is? - Yeah. It's a... - An exabyte is a million terabytes. - Right. MacGreco is housed in an impregnable room. Shock mounted... temperature controlled and it locks down if it even sensors it is under attack. If it locks down, there wouldn't even be able to get out of the room. Couldn't we just shut it off? You know, cut the wires? That could work. Better still you'd just kick the plug out of the socket. - Seriously. - No, short of walking into that room... with a bloody magnetron around your neck. You know what a magnetron is? Something that screws up the Greco. Aha... short of that. I'm kinda shocked this is where we are, because... - This is a problem. - That's what I said. But if we could somehow... No there is no if... It can not be shut off. I mean you'd need a real natural disaster an actual act of God. - But if we could... - You can't. - But if we did? - You can't. You could. Don't flatter. If we could, how long would it take to reboot? Because it's so sophisticated 3,5 minutes. Would be enough. Pick a natural disaster. Get me a laptop. Now the drill access is through a sewer main of Paris Drive. Grind along here into the northwest corner of the hotel. Here. Probably about 6,00 Rpm so you won't wake all the neighbors. When it reaches the resident's frequency... the building acts like a tuning fork. To the people inside it will feel like an earthquake. That should knock out the Greco. And that's your exit strategy. - Hey Bash? - I'm up here. - Hey! - Here you go. Hey, where the mags? - Linus... - I can't find those things. I need them. I can't leave. - Why are you such a... - I'm sorry... ask somebody else. - Ask Livingston. - You're such a wowser. Look, read this to Reuben. I've done research. Positive messages get through. I can't say this. No, no I'm saying it. You're just a vessel. Come on Basher, look, why don't you take a break? I'll watch all the equipment. You'll go read it to him. Shit. You know we never digging the tunnel... they had teams of guys monitoring this. Yeah? How many? Teams. That's a 5.6. If you don't think a 5.6 is possible or even likely. Then quit frankly you don't know much about Byllups senior report... specifically the Saxon and the Mohabi block. I know what you're hoping then it'll be just a blind trust... See that, that's Rusty. He's doing an Irwin Allen. See that? He's not deaf, Linus. - Why am I here? - Close your hotel. Permanently. What? We haven't even opened yet. - What are all those people downstairs? - Well, it's a soft open. It's like an out of town preview... What do you think? You just come in here to tell me to close my hotel. I'm not gonna close my hotel. Sir, if you just let me come in with my team and our gear here for a few days. - No. - I can proof what I'm saying. No hey, there is no way we are exposing our exclusive clientele to a bunch of... Scientists? We wouldn't want that, would we? Let's just hope for the best, shall we. That should be enough. Take this. It's a standard torsion seismograph. If there is a foreshock it will register... and you just might have time te evacuate. I don't want this thing on my desk. No sir, let me tell you what you don't want. Your hotel on the cover of Time magazine... in a twisted heap of steel and glass. You and your customers are underneath it. Headline reads: Who's to blame? That's what you don't want. Okay... Put an evacuation plan on paper. Will do, sir. Consider it done. I do thank you for your time. If you really wanna put yourself to good use... Why don't you hit the tables? I don't gamble, sir... neither should you not with people's lives. I'll screen the meetings more careful the next time. I'm sorry, Mr. Bank. And now we have a camera in Bank's office. I see you, Reuben. A letter from Basher. Dear Reuben... as the band said: two hearts beat as one. When men have been in battle together... they are bonded like the flower and the soil and the sun... and like the moon catches the light... Reuben, I'll go ahead and leave this... here. I see you, pall. So she says: What did I do? What did I do? I said: What do I look like, a pancake eater? - So you just left her down on the floor? - Right on the floor. - For how long? - The next morning. Good. Yeah. Thanks Debbie. Pack your swimsuit. I don't wanna see any slack faces in front of the house. - Only happy faces, no slack faces. - Right. Go! - Go! Go! - Right. I'm sorry. Sorry. Mr. Shields, where are you going? We got you proof grand opening. A friend of mine, a very serious man... told me very seriously... that'll be a good idea if I left the hotel. I'm taking his suggestion. He can't be too serious... if he knew what I got in store for you now. Willie, I'm outta here. Thank you. - See you Willie. - I really hate to see you go, man. Let's go. Bank here. Confirmed? Bine. - Where? - The gentleman in the Trilby, sir. The what? The Doctor Dolittle hat. Why don't you just say that? Okay. - Excuse me... Mr.? - Chubb. Kensington Chubb. How do you do, Mr. Chubb? Would you like to follow me, I think I might be able to move things along. How very nice of you. No, no, no, no, no! Her Highness is a very delicate animal. It upsets her so everyone but papa carries her about. All's well, dear. - Why don't you just follow me? - How very considerate. I do appreciate what you�re doing for me. Oh, sorry. - Why does he get to go... - He's a V.I.P. So what's that make me? A V.U.P.? A Very Unimportant Person? I have a reservation. De ce nu iei o pauz�? M� ocup eu de oaspete. Hello sir, I'm sorry for the wait. Welcome to the Bank. Hello. Kensington Chubb here. Saul, it's me. He's in his room. Blast him. Got it. Gloves and mask don't take any chances. Got it. Hello, front desk. Yeah, I'm in room 1706... and there's some sort of terrible smell in here. It smells like... Well but... I need, I need to move! Certainly, sir. I'll just see if we have anything available. I'm sorry, sir. We are fully booked for the grand opening gala... but I'll let you know if anything ends up. Enjoy your stay at the Bank. - But... - Goodbye. - That I'm ready to see all available rooms. - My way, mister. - Thank you. Her highness is so very sensitive to smells. Get away. If you keep on complaining... they'll fire us, just for listening... I just say that the working conditions are bad. Nobody can deny that. Payment... little. Working hours... long. That's the way it is in Mexico. Did you all forget about... general Emiliano Zapata? When they took the land from the poor... they believed it was forever stolen. But Zapata said to them: it's better to die on your feet... than to live on your knees. And they fought. Hello. I'd like a table for one. I hear your risotto is tremendous. It is tremendous. - The name on the reservation? - Hanna Walking. I'm sorry, sir. I can't accommodate you. Those are reserved. May I recommend one of our other restaurants? Ling Su, Cantonesian cuisine. Great. Okay it's not a prop, for prop's sake. No, the Brody can work. What? Just you got the greatest cover known to men? Right? So you don't even have to think about these things anymore. Congratulations! No, maybe you're getting soft. No, I'm not gonna put Danny on... or Rusty. Just... Goodbye dad. Okay. I rerouted all the impulses going to the main randomizer. In Black Jack the best is 21. It's called Black Jack. So the results should be 20's and Black Jack... to all the players... with the dealer "bust". Your call. Do over. A do over. Okay... I'll keep working. - Good. - Great. Yes, I'll have the dumplings and the Shataki mushroom... and a sparkling water. Staff... casino... food... room cleanliness. At this point... there's nothing I can do to help. He said that he'd be... Cum �i zice? Ambulatory by now. - Are you keeping his spirits. - We're working on it. Thanks Stan. Oh no, that's way too much. - No. - It's not like I removed a bullet. This side. - Dr. Stan! - Hey Linus, how's it going? - Great. - We're dead. - What are you talking about? - The factory in Mexico is offline. - Offline? - What does that mean exactly? - I couldn't get details. It just shut down. - You don't think that... - Yeah, I do. - Oh boy. So he says that they want their bread and they want their roses too. We better get down there and straighten this out. - He doesn't listen to me. - You're going. If we don't get this factory back online... we have to dock this showboat. What do you mean? Just the whole operation... Dude, I got the showboat metaphor. Thank you, Linus. I gotta get back. What? What do you mean "what"? Little something for the effort, maybe. We pull tips. The other guys are gonna think I'm kiting. - Come on. - You want it to come out of my pocket, or something? Yeah. Take it easy. What's the problem? The Tricode Optimizers that be into into the nipple sleeve receivers... pulverated their lubricating blides... up against tension against the sidewalls. Aha... Picture a knee but without any cartilage, bone on bone. Where does that put us? Cattled. Okay. The good news is there's another B600 available. The one that dug the Chunnel. - I thought we had that one. - We did. This one dug from the French side. The bad news is with timing this short we're gonna have to buy this one. - And it's expensive. - How much do we have left? If I tap the whole contingency just over 10 million. - How close does that get us? - No. How much is it? - 30. - 30? - 6. - 6? 36. - Isn't there anyway without the drill? - The drill is the exit strategy. Well... is there a way for us to raise money? - I got everything I have in this already. - So do I. - Me too. - We all do. If anyone of us was lying up on that bed Reuben wouldn't rest... until he made it right. I gotta go up there and tell him that we failed... and there's nothing we can do about it? - So we're stopping? - I'm not saying that. - So what then? Scuzi, signori. Mr. Reuben is talking. He asks for Mr. Danny. I hear cars pulling in... I hear whispering conversations, Linus crying. Why don't you tell me what everyone else seems to know? Well the thing is... Wait! Hi. Good to see you smiling again. Can I talk to you guys for a second? That's your idea? Well, we've shaken all the trees, we've looked under every rock... we've searched every... We talked to everybody we can trust. I know it's not a great idea, but it is an idea... and I think as long as we have one idea we shouldn't give up. I was really hoping to avoid that this time. Number one. If any of you is trying to screw me... he'll be dead. And I'm gonna be looking in on the operation... just to make sure. Number two. I'll lend you this money I am your senior partner. Last money in, first money out. And you will double my investment. Double? - Is that a "yes"? - Double. That monstrosity that Bank calls a hotel... casts a shadow over my pool. Break him. Break him in half. The man has no taste... and yet every time he opens a hotel... he wins a Royal Review Board... Five Diamond Award. Every time he wins the Five Diamond Award, he celebrates by... We know. - By buying one for his wife. - You mean five. - One is five. - Number three. I want you to steal the diamonds. - No, that's... - Can't be done. - We don't have the manpower or time. - Or a way. - We get caught we go away for life. We're not gonna risk that so you can get his diamonds. They're not for me. I just want him to lose what matters most to him. Do what you want with them. But you need to steal the diamonds... or you find somebody else to finance your drill. The B600 drill. So what's the deal with these diamonds then? They're out of Tiffany they're 30 karat each. Matches the award plaques... On today's market they'd be worth... 250 million dollars. Bank's already purchased the next one in anticipation of winning the award. The rest are kept in a secure glass viewing boot at the top of the tower. - And Benedict said we can keep? - That's what he said. Then why want these diamonds on the agenda to begin with? Because it can't be done. This is why revenge jobs don't work, Daniel. You put yourself in a position, you know you should walk away, but you can't. This is how guys die or go to jail. Alright. Does anybody wanna walk away? - Saul? - I say I was walking away. Let's cut the son of a bitch. Okay. Bank fired Gerry Guapi Maior and 4 others, just so he could say he designed the hotel himself. What this means to us? There's no set of unified plans. - Routes? - According to March 05 plans... there's interior shafts with potential access to diamond viewing room. But the May 05 plans only show shafts: here and here. September 05 shows no shafts... and December 06 plans are the same as... - How many sets of plans are there? - That's ten. Since we can't trust the accuracy of these drawings... based on my walking around... these are the shafts we have to clap an eyeball on. Now there's no knowledge of floor thickness underneath the diamonds. Anything thicker than 5 inches we have a problem. Right. This here is the elevator shaft... which can be accessed through a super high roller villa. - Got it? - Alright. So who's gonna be our super high roller? I'm so sorry to been a little tardy mister..? Pepperidge, Lenny Pepperidge. I'm Mr. Weng's communicator. He'd like you to know that he was waiting for 7 minutes. We've received your 10 million dollar cash deposit... and I would like you to know that what we normally do... Mr. Weng won't take a line. He's a man of extraordinary discipline. He's willing to risk 10 million, not a dollar more. Did you say Mr. Weng was in real estate, Mr. Pepperidge? That's right. I only ask because his name... doesn't come up on our standard file database. And Mr. Weng and I have worked very hard to keep it that way. Exactly what kind of real estate did you say that Mr. Weng was involved? Look he owns all the air south of Beijing. - The air? - Put it to you this way... try building something larger than 3 stories... in the Tianjin province... see if his name comes up in your database then. How quickly can you transfer his money from your cage to the cage at the Bellagio? Now I don't think that's necessary... at all Mr. Pepperidge, we've reserved our largest villa for Mr. Weng. Extension 765. Hello Robert. This is Abigail Sponder. Your bureau introduced us not too long ago... at the gaming fraud seminar. I remember you. What can I do for you, Miss Sponder? Well, you know... We're about to open a new property... and there are a couple of characters here... I'm not to sure about. Why don't you give me their names and I'll check them out. Up you go. - What do you mean you're not going? - You gotta go. Too fast? You did the bullet train stunt with all of Asia watching... elevators aren't faster than that. That was C.G.I.? Wait, so this one got legs? Jesus. - Okay then. - We're down again. Well what about Rouben? - Well - It's just a living. I mean, if we paid somebody to read to him. Maybe he'll see his next birthday. - January? - I don't think so. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. And then what happened? She said she liked surprises. I don't think that's what she meant. You think? - So she put down the remote. - And I put the towel back on. Now, those are the waters. - Relationships can be... - Sure. - But they're also... - That's right. I've gone through so many blueprints... I can taste the ink on my fingers. Yeah... The only other access point is through the main air-conditioning duct. - We gotta move that guard. - We don't have anything on him. Let's find something. I can get to the helipad from there too Let's find something. this used to be the dunes. Reuben thought me to shoot craps here when I was a kid. We'd play hardware and double sixes. He straightened me out. I was 20... 2. First time I met Reuben... he looked me off getting cheated at an old dealer's game at the old rancher. and he bought me breakfast. Sands was there... Desert Inn. They built them a lot smaller back then. They seemed pretty big. The town has changed. You know if I read one more puff piece about Vegas legend, Terry Benedict... I'm gonna have to buy a magazine of my own. And I haven't forgotten about that phone. Ah, the gold model, the one that retails for 10.000. The double light Samsung. Okay, that would be... Ungettable. No, no... You call Teddy Sanders of promotion. I did that and he promised you... the very first one as soon as it comes of the line in September. That's July for me. What did you say about Samsung? He said he used to bowl with the owner of Samsung. Well call Danny. Oh and tell Danny I know the perfect guy we can use for the role-play at the Expo. We're worried dress up this. We were! We are. Randall is. - I must have put... - Don't blame yourself... I should have fired you a week ago. Bye. Are you having a nice stay? And you, sir How's your Bank experience? Can I be of any personal assistance to you? This is quit unorthodox. I have never found myself talking directly to a hotel owner. I understand, you're just a customer. And I am just an engaged innkeeper. - Spot on. - Spot on. Well, so far, in my book... this establishment is: aces. Aces? That's good. The ace of diamonds, I hope. I see what you... Diamonds, indeed, yes. - Hey. - Hey. Okay the guard by the main elevator shaft has a full Hitler for a son. - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, no, I just bit into a pepper. - Anyway... Is that... Are you... Are you watching Oprah? With a bottle of wine? Did you TIVO this. - I was reading the paper. - With the sound of her volume? Not one, not two, not three but twelve new beds... It's not just about the kids, I mean I'm happy for the kids. So I think we've come up with the answer to your prayers... This is what I think we gonna do: we are buying you a house! How's it going in Mexico? Turk's there. Are they really gonna built her a new home? Yeah, the whole family. - What could I say? - That's what I said. Hey. You guys been talking to my father? Why would we do that? That's not to know. Well, look... we just wanted to know how the nose was working. I knew it, man. He just can't leave it alone. What did he say? Oh I told him... The nose plays. - The nose does play. - It's great. Great stuff. Thanks. Turk? Hey, are you gonna get the factory open? Oh yes, we just got a great management. They can't be treating us like this. Well, I gotta go. - Yeah, Ortega here. - Mr. Ortega, this is... - vice principal Meckler. - Oh no... I'm afraid so, we've had another incident with Manny and Miss Kelso. It was the leg this time. I need somebody to come down and pick him up. My wife can't... I'm sorry sir, your wife we haven't been able to get a hold off. We left messages. Yo-yo-yo-yo buddy-buddy-buddy, do me a favor. Cover my post for half an hour. Oh man, I just gotta go... Come on man, help me out... my kid just his leg again. - Really? - Yeah. - Alright man, I owe you one, alright. - Yeah, you do. Alright... according to this... the room where the diamonds are held... is directly above here. $250,000,000 worth of diamonds, 18" of floor concrete in the way. Man, we can't drill through that. It's just one thing too many. Look, we're talking about a secure room, Terry. This isn't just a glass box these diamonds are housed in. This is 2" thick concussion proof glass... wired with pressure sensitive 7 digit coded alarms. Kill the power to the hotel. It's worked for you before. No-no-no. See the case and the alarm both have independent power supply. And besides you don't run the same gag twice... you do the next gag. How big a deal is it if we don't get the diamonds? You have all your fares in order? Alright, so what we'll have to do... is get inside that glass case and switching the replicas. How are we supposed to get in the room? Bank is the only one with access, right? - Sponder has too. - Sponder has access? Then we're in. Sponder is a... believe the term is "cougar". It's not my term. I read about it in Maxim magazine. Okay, well let's get Rusty in position. No-no-no not Rusty... Me. I'm in. I'm already in there. I put this whole thing in motion before I even realized it. I'm so deep into Pepperidge... I don't even think, I just react I am him. You know it. Great. Great. Would you just tell them. Now you don't understand English? He's not trying not to laugh. You know what? I can do it. He says he can do it. - Alright Linus, go get her. - Alright. - Give him the accelerator. - Natural? Chemical? - I don't need an accelerator. - Make it powerful. Thanks a lot. I'll play it at Gilroy. - You don't need a... - Just one Gilroy, last time you did... News from Mexico. From a journalist I used to... She's an ally of the workers. What she tells me is that the strike... hinges on working conditions... and the fact that labor are underpaid by 50%. I'm sure you all agree is always about the money. - Ho much are we talking about? - 36.000. - How many workers? - 200. Give or take. - Alright, that's.. - Just over 7 million dollars. No-no-no not 36k per person... 36 total. Turk, you virtually got him holding out for $3.50 a week? It is a 5% increase. We ran him a check. We'll postdate it. Say to my brother to keep his ears shut. This is Roman Nagel... If your feel consciousness absolutely has to intrude upon mine... leave me a message. Roman? It's Livingston. I heard you were out here taking some meetings... and I was wondering if you could help me out. The technical problem I've been having... with one of my assignments. Oh and I was hoping we could, you know, keep it on a down low... from Danny and the other guys... that I'm coming you for help. So, call me when you get this. Okay? Okay. Bye. Is Sponder with him? A whole new segment... - Which car? - That's a lot to sober... Which rolls? Exclusive rights... What's the ETA? Okay. He's on his way. - Think he's gonna fall for this? - You did. You're ready?

Well, I'm just very moved by the kinda work they're doing there... and you gotta start somewhere and luckily you know... the casino business is doing well... and I hope there's more millions to come for other organizations. But, like I said... I was really moved by that place...
