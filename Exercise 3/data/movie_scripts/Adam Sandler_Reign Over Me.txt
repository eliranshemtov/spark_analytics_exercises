-New patient? -Yes. I was referred by my lawyer about veneers. You're a new patient. Fill this out... ...so we know who to contact in case we lose you in the chair. That was a joke, sweetie. I was being funny. Hello. Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson. Oh, it's Miss Remar. And I know who you are. I see another doctor in the building regularly. I've been on the elevator with you a few times. Oh, okay. You're married? I never noticed the ring before. Oh, yes, I am. I'm married. All right, what are we doing for you today? One veneer, is that right? They told me you don't usually do just one. We do whatever's needed. Allie. All right. Let's see. -Now, which one is it? -I don't know. You tell me. So another cutie with a crush, huh? What is it with you? So you'll be back next week? You're gonna schedule Miss Remar next week for the veneer. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna clear the schedule the whole week... ...so that you could be mentally prepared for it. Okay? It was so nice to finally meet you. Oh, yeah. You too. Okay. I need the-- Oh, it's my daughters. I'm gonna need that jacket. -Okay, you stay, and then I'll reach. -Sorry. No, that's fine. I'm minutes away. Charlie--? Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman! Charlie! Charlie. Charlie Fineman. I'm so sick of your father. He's in that bed again. Just as mean and evil as he can be. Like a pig with a bullet in his head. You take your walk today, Mom? I'll take that as a no. Dad? I hate this city. I hate this damn city. I don't know why you brought us here. I got the papaya juice you asked for. Hate this damn city. And the smell. All that garbage all up and down the street. Daddy? I need money for the dress for the dinner... ...I'm going to with the Jacobsons. And you'll have to drive me... ...because Mom's gonna be at Cherie's chorus practise. Okay. We have to talk about getting a cell phone. This morning, you said we could talk about it tonight. I thought we talked about the cell-phone issue. But I'm 1 3 and I still share with my little sister. Oh, right. Because you only need a cell phone... -...if Mommy or Daddy's late-- -I ran into Charlie Fineman today. Really? How is he? I don't know. I was in the car and he was on foot. He was coming out of a hardware store. He was carrying paint. You think he's still practising? Who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy? He's an old college friend of mine, baby. He was my college roommate, actually. I haven't talked to him in a long, long time. Is he the one from dental school... ...whose family was on the plane? Is that Charlie Fineman? Yeah. That's Charlie Fineman. You know, I decided to sign us up for another photography class. You did? You already signed us up? Yeah, but this time for the advanced one. I thought we had fun last quarter, didn't you? What, you don't want to? No, I do. Don't you? I loved it. -I had a really good time. -Yeah. -Didn't you love it? -I did. And now Advanced Photography? I mean, wow. I'm-- Yeah. Good. No sugar. Don't take that to school, okay? Whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks. -Hey, Angela. -Dr. Johnson. What is it about us always leaving the building at the same time? -It's quitting time. -That's true. -You good? -Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Good. Let me ask you something. Most married men have hobbies. Okay, Alan. Don't do this. Come on. -Don't do what? -We talked about this. It's not really fair for you to wait for me out here on the street. If you wanna make an appointment, we can make an appointment. Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing. Now, you remember the friend I was asking you about? The friend who has no friends? Other than you? Yeah, him. So he's a married guy, right? And he's got a great wife and the whole nine. But she will not let him-- I mean, it's like he can't just-- I mean, guys have guy hobbies, right? They play poker, they golf, they do shit. Okay, you know what? Stop. Stop. I can't treat you from the lobby to the car park. Treat me? I'm not-- I just asked you a question. -Well, whatever you wanna call it-- -No, you're right. -It's inappropriate. -You're right. I get it. Let me ask you one thing. I want your opinion as a woman, Angela. As a woman. Look, if I have this recurring dream where... ...I'm sitting on my couch... ...and it turns into a big vat of rubber, what is that? Why don't you let me refer you to someone else? Okay. Well... ...I hope it works out for you. You wait for me enough times out on the street, though... ...you might owe me some dental work. Have a nice day. Bingo. There we go. -That was a tough one. -Okay. Absolutely. Now it all will fall into place. Dad, can you take me to Becky Fishman's? Sweetie, it's 9:30. She wants me to spend the night. Well, Daddy's had a long day at work... ...and he's finally finding some time to enjoy himself. Just have her come over here. And we can study your French together. Oh, you know what? I'll take her. I'll go. Babe. We've come this far. We've been working on this all week. I know. I'll go. I'll go, and then I'll just come right back. Don't be mad if I have this all done by the time you get back. Because I'm on a roll here. You're gonna miss out on all the action. Just make sure you save me some sky, okay? You know you owe that child bigtime. You would've thought she got you out of traffic school... ...by the look on your face. Good night, babe. -Good night. -Thanks. Hey, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie Fineman, hey! Charlie, stop! -Hey, Charlie. Hey, man. -Yeah? -It's Alan. -Hey. How are you? I saw you coming out of a paint store a couple weeks ago and.... I was screaming for you, honking the horn. I stopped the car, jumped out in traffic. It was crazy. Then I tried to get in touch with you, but nobody had any info on you. Oh, good, good. Very cool. -How you doing? -So we know each other? Are you kidding me? It's Alan Johnson, Charlie. We went to dental school together. Burrows Hall. I was your college roommate. You don't remember me? Yeah, very cool. Very cool. -Good. Good to see you, Burrows. -It's Johnson. Charlie, you seriously don't remember me? -We were college roommates? -Yeah. Yeah, you slept naked most nights. And you were a sleepwalker. It was the worst two years of my life. Hey, are you practising, man? I tried to get in touch through the Dental Guild-- I'm practising all the time, up in the valley. Took down 1 2 of the Colossus so far. The valley? What is that? Is that a medical complex or something? It's more like another dimension. You take a journey and discover yourself. -Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink? -I can't drink. I can't drink. I can't drink. I can't drink. I gotta get going. Then a coffee or something. Let's just go get a cup of coffee. Real quick. I would just love to catch up with you, man. Hey, Charlie. This okay? You like trivia? Name the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes. Can you name them? Okay, Michigan is one. Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior. That was an easy one. That's fifth-grade shit. So, what have you been up to lately, Charlie? I'm stuck between Pale White and Moon White. I tried Butterscotch Yellow. I couldn't live with it. You painting something? You're remodelling or...? You were my college roommate. That was a long time ago. -A whole other life. -Oh, yeah. No shit. It's good to see your face. Johnson. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Charlie. Yeah. All right. You gotta take those shoes off. Thank you. Great record collection. Yeah. I'm happy with it. -A lot of vinyl. -Yeah. Over 5500 so far. It's a work in progress. Kitchen remodel? What is this? "Shadows of the Colossus." Can I use your bathroom, Charlie? Oh, in the back. Nice music room. Good? Okay. There you go, Allie. Thank you. I'm sorry about the way I behaved the last time I was here, doctor. But when I see you in the building, you always seem very busy. Preoccupied. Even when you're with the other doctors, you seem so solitary. So alone. I don't know why, but that seems very familiar to me. Yeah. Well. I hope you're-- I just thought that if you wanted me to... ...I would. With my mouth. I would. You could lock that door... ...tell the nurse not to come in. I'd do it. I'd enjoy making you happy. You have to leave. I have this odd sense of intimacy towards you. I don't even know why. I told my shrink, and she said I should act on it. Oh, she did? You need to get a new shrink. Get several. And get a new dentist too. You gotta get out of here, Miss Remar. I'm serious. I need you to leave right now. Please. Go. Okay. Come on. Okay. The fuck--? I need you not to reschedule Miss Remar for anything. Okay. Ever again. Nothing. Okay. I don't want this woman as a patient. -Got it. I got it. -Fine. Thank you. Excuse me! Not right now. Hey. Melanie, call her. -Miss Remar? -On the phone, I mean. Don't-- Miss Remar, you need to find another dentist. -Excuse me? -You heard me. Dr. Johnson don't want you as a patient... ...neither do any other doctors here... ...so go somewhere, bury your face in the phone book... ...and find another dentist, all right? -" Bury your face in the phone book"? -Yes. You have to be bold to make these kind of people go away. Thanks for holding. Can I help you? I'm just going up to see a friend of mine, Charlie Fineman. Nobody by that name lives here. Sorry. That's fine. I'll just wait for the landlord. That's me. Landlady. Adell Modell, landlady from hell. Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson. I'm a friend of Charlie's. -Sure. -We went to dental school together-- I was in his apartment the other night. We were playing... ..."Shadows of the Colossus" or something. You were up there in his apartment the other night? That's a load of crap. He hasn't had anybody up there in four years. Just me, Sugarman the accountant, the cleaning girl. He doesn't know about the cleaning girl. -I'm not lying to you. I was up there. -Yeah. He's remodelling his kitchen. Now, how would I know that? He's been remodelling that kitchen once every couple of months. That tells me nothing. Go away. Johnson. Johnson! -Yo. -Hey. Alan! Alan Johnson. This is my college roommate. It's my college roommate. I used to sleep in the nude. Check this out. I got a.... You'll appreciate this. The Pretenders, It's one of the great debut albums of all time. Yeah, that's you. Terrible taste in music. No, no, not true. Not true. Smell these things. I love the way they smell. Take a whiff. Brings back a feeling. Smells like the late '7 0s, don't it? -The early '80s. Yeah. -Charlie! Charlie! It's okay, Charlie. I'll take care of them. -Who's that? -Charlie, we just wanna talk. -We gotta go. We gotta go. -What? Why? Who is that? Johnson, hop on. Hop on, Johnson. -Hop on? -Get on. Get on. Johnson. -Who is that? -Johnson, damn it, get on. -Just get on the back. -Wait a minute! Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie! Oh, shit! Charlie. I know, I know. All right. You're late. They're pissed. Name the one national U.S. monument that's movable. Suck my ass, retard. You're late. Get in there. No. San Francisco cable cars. Good. I didn't know that one either. That's a good one. That's a great one if you ever wanna stump somebody. If you guys could not laugh at anything I say, that'd really.... I'm trying to get my self-esteem to go to, like, seven percent. Could I get another Heineken? -You want another root beer? -I got enough. Thanks. Thanks. Hey, it was fun watching you up there tonight, man. It was good music. I don't know if I'd go that far. But you know what it reminded me of? It reminded me of school. When you used to jam to that Bruce Springsteen album. -What was the name of that album? -Bruce Springsteen.... Yeah. What was that? The River, -The River? -The River, You remember that? I was always trying to get you to play The O'Jays or Earth, Wind & Fire... ...but you always wanted to jam to The River, I don't remember jamming to it. Maybe if you smelled it, it'd all come rushing back. -This was fun, man. -Oh, yeah. I had a good day today. Riding around on that silly scooter. It was-- It was my first time doubles. -It was fun. It was fun. -Yeah. I don't do anything like that. Lot of girls here, Charlie. That's gotta be half of the appeal, right? Why'd you ask me that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just making small talk, you know? You're single now. You can do whatever you-- -What? -After what happened... -...with your family and everything-- -Whoa, hey, I don't have a family. No. No, I know. I was just trying to make small talk, but that was stupid. Who sent you here? -Did they send you here? -What are you talking about? -Are you a specialist? -A sp--? No, I'm not-- -What are you talking about? -Don't lie to me! Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me. -Charlie, calm down. -Why are you here? Why? Why? -Answer my fucking question. -Charlie, you're screaming. Why are you here right now talking to me? -Relax. Okay? -Why? Why? Shit! -The fuck is wrong with you? -Why are you talking to me? Oh, now I'm boring you? Mr. Heckler? I'm bored too. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I'm sorry. You tell them to leave me alone! Alan. When you get a minute, we need to see you. Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit. She claims that you sexually assaulted her in the office on several occasions. That is ridiculous, all right? That's absurd. Well, we checked with Melanie. Donna Remar. What do you know about her? This woman is insane. Okay? She came in, I put a single veneer on her... ...she tells me she's got this obsession-- Excuse me, Marie. She said she wants to give me oral sex in the office. You know what, you need to make this go away. We can't handle a hit like this on our insurance. Even if we win, we're gonna get killed. How do I do that? How do I make this go away? I don't know how you make it go away. You see her again, you discuss it.... Damn. I mean, isn't this exactly like what it was the last time? Woman falls for you, you lead them along-- -You know what, John? -No. No. What, Johnson? I'll get into it. Dr. Johnson? I need to speak with you. I'm Ginger Timpleman... ...and I'm Charlie Fineman's mother-in-law. -Did you know Charlie's family? -No. His parents died when he was in grade school. He lived with an aunt before college. I met her a couple of times. She passed just before the wedding. You know, my wife and I, we tried to call him so many times. Hadn't seen him in years, and I read about what happened in the paper... ...and I was just-- I was just heartbroken for him, you know? For them. He just, you know, shut down. Quit work. He stopped wanting to talk about her. Then he acted like he didn't remember them. Then he pretended he didn't remember us. Yeah. All my husband and I wanna do is see him. And that crazy landlady and his business manager, Sugarman... ...both conspire to keep us away. -Sugarman? -Yeah, I don't care for him. Who knows what that little shyster's taking from Charlie. -What is there to take? -Between the government payout... ...the insurance policy, Charlie has enough to take care of himself... ...put it that way. My husband retired young. He was a cop. You know, we were young. Young to be grandparents. I was gonna do nothing but travel... ...and spoil my granddaughters. Then those monsters flew over here from across the world... ...and rearranged my dance card. -Sorry. -Of course you are. But he needs help. Not the kind that landlady and some little accountant can give him. He needs a therapist. And he needs family. Guess what. Jonathan and I are the only family Charlie's got. Hey. Hey. Somebody's at the door. Somebody's at the door. Cherie. Cherie. -Get away from the door. -What are you doing? You don't go to the door in the middle of the night. You know that. I think it's Charlie Fineman. Is that Charlie? -Oh, yeah, that's him. -Okay. So let him in. Yeah? Were you in bed already? What's going on? It's 1 0:30. I'm always in bed at 1 0:30. -That sucks. That's grim. -You don't have any root beer on you... -...do you? -No, why? Alan. Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane. Hi, I believe we met about 1 5 years ago in Central Park. -I don't expect you to remember it. -I don't. Okay. This is our daughter Cherie. Nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman. Go to bed, sweetheart. What's going on, Charlie? You wanna go out, man? Go have some fun? Let's hang out. -Right now? -Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's-- -Can he go out? Is he allowed out? -Charlie, don't do that. Don't ask my wife permission for me to go out. I'm right here in front of you. I'm not 7 years old. You're right. Can you go out? She's threatening to sue you? What does she want? She wants to go down on me. -Well, you tell her you can't do that. -No, I know. -You tell her you're married? -She knows. It's not a deterrent for this one. I mean, she's got some kind of a fixation or something. Oh, well, fix it for her. It's not funny, Charlie. -No, no, no. -It's really not funny, I mean.... -My partners are up my ass. -Right. We already pay an obscene amount in liability insurance. You should tell your partners they can do to you what the girl wants to do. Fuck them. I don't know. It's a five-year lease, 50 grand a month... ...my name on it. My partners get pissed off... ...and they leave me holding the bag, that's it, I'm done. -Yeah. -I put the whole thing together. They act like I'm the one who works for them. But the girl, what are you gonna do about that? That's weird, you know? It's kind of heavy. Yeah, it is. I'm telling you, this girl's seriously troubled. Oh, yeah. She got a lot of problems if she wants to blow you. She's out of her mind. I've seen that thing. -That's very funny. -No, no, no. No, it is-- Are you having fun? To tell you the truth, I kind of am, Johnson. It's nice to see you in the soup like this. It's funny. Just not used to it. -Here. Take it easy. Take it easy. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Any chance of you getting audited this week? Because that would make things even better. Or maybe we could go somewhere... ...and you could burn your tongue on some pizza. I'd like that too. I would love that. I need you to hold for one moment. You are not gonna believe who this is on the phone. -Who? -The nut. At this point in my life, you're gonna have to be very specific. Donna Remar. She wants to come in for another consultation for some more veneers. Can you believe that? Ma'am? -Ma'am? -Schedule it. -Excuse me? -Schedule it in my office alone. -Morning, Oscar. -Hey, doc. Good to see you. -Hello, Dr. Johnson. -Hello. -I've got a question. -I'm sure you do. -No, it's not about me this time. -How refreshing. It's about a friend. Really, though. I mean, really, a real friend. He lost his whole family in a plane crash. -Right. -It's horrible. I mean, his wife, his three daughters. This guy used to be a dentist. -How long ago? -It's a few years ago... ...and he's lost now. You know? He's completely lost. I bumped into him. We used to be college roommates for two years. -He didn't even remember me. -Well, offhand, that sounds like... ...post-traumatic stress disorder. Maybe worse. I couldn't really know without seeing him. It sounds like he needs help. -Is he getting help? -I don't know. I mean, the whole thing is.... It's really odd, you know? It's crazy odd. How are you? I'm fine. I got nothing to complain about. Does that mean you're fine? Very good. You are gonna be sending me a bill one day. You might wanna check your mailbox. -Okay. -Dr. Johnson, I think it would be... ...really good for you to talk to someone. I just sense that it would be... ...good for you to be a little bit more communicative. I hope that didn't offend you. Okay. Well, I'll see you soon? Okay. -Charlie. -In the back! -Hope the shoes are off. -Shoes are off. Shoes are off. Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man. You almost done? Is that The River? Yeah. You know, I gotta get you enrolled in a music-appreciation class. Oh, right, yeah. Tell that to Clarence Clemons. What's going on? What's going on with the girl? The crazy girl, the one who wants your penis. How's she doing? -Let's not talk about her. -Yeah, you wanna--? Lose that tie. Lose the tie and the scarf. The whole outfit. -For what? -Come on, take it off. Psychedelic time. Psychedelic time. I smell a Fineman jam session coming on. Yeah, Burrows Hall-style. Burrows Hall. Jamming and jamming and jamming. -Here. -I don't play guitar, Charlie. Hey, Johnson, you're barely a dentist. You pull people's teeth all day. It don't matter. Come on. Come on. All right. Get that in you. Get that in you. -Let me do this. -You'll get to this. Come on. Let me hear some of that. I don't know how to play this, Charlie Fineman! -Alan Johnson. Alan Johnson! -Charlie Fineman! Good night, Jersey! -Philadelphia. Philadelphia! -Good night, Philly! Baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you know I don't ever do anything like that. I just didn't wanna call you and wake you up. I was stuck in Charlie world. I couldn't... ...leave. This is not okay. You staying out all night... ...it's not acceptable. I'm just saying, the guy's in a lot of pain. It's sad over there, baby. It's just-- Just a sea of sadness. -Yeah. -Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. -You don't have an appointment, sir? -Oh, we're friends. -What--? -We were college roommates. -And? -I used to sleep in the nude. -Charlie? -All right, come in. I hear " Colossus." Hey. Hey, hey, buddy. Take the shoes off. I told you. I told you. Hey, didn't you just...? All right. All right. Hey, let me try it. Hang on. -Let me try it. -Just watch me do it first. Let me just try it. -Okay, how do you shoot it? -Square is to stab him. That's the bird. You wanna shoot him, get his attention. All right. All right, get your arrow ready. And let me pluck him right in the uterus. Aim what? Oh, fuck. I could show you how to do it, give you some hints... ...but I'll warn you, it's very addictive. Well, I don't have an addictive personality... ...so just show me how to do it. Is something I said funny? All right. That'll call your horse. The triangle is how you jump.... Okay, okay, very good. -Stab his arm. -I'm stabbing him in the arm. -No, you gotta stab in the right spot. -I'm stabbing it right there. You gotta be on the light. -Shit. -That's not gonna work. I gotta climb this big son of a bitch-- Look, just put it down, all right? Rest. Next time you come, you'll be better. Let it soak in. No, no, no. Right now. No next. Now. I thought you don't have an addictive personality. That was the line of the night, man. You're an addict. -Say it, man. Say you're an addict. -Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right. -Come on, now, stab his wing. -Oh, God. -Oh, I'm on your ass, bird. -Stab his wing. All right. Yeah. Colossus! That's the first three.... Okay, now, wait. You said they get bigger too? Well, no, it's different. It's like you're gonna use a bow and arrow more. -Each one will have different powers. -What are we doing? Wait a minute, Charlie, you said get a burger, man. I can't-- I can't do this. I gotta work in the morning. Yeah, so you'll work, you'll be tired. So what? This is like a marathon, man. It'll go till 5 in the morning. I can't-- You'll go to sleep tomorrow night at 8:00 instead of 1 0:30. How's that? Is that enough sleep, you faggot? Hey, don't call me faggot. -Are you a faggot? -Quit saying faggot. Just don't say faggot. Don't just call people faggot. That's rude. To a gay guy it is. To you, it's just... ...a funny word, like pound cake or pickle. You're a fucked-up dude, man. I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay. You really need some Mel. You need some Mel. I'll take one adult and one faggot. Come on, you really need to come in here. Johnson. -Johnson. -Okay. Good decision. Hey! The sheriff is a nig-- -What did he say? -The sheriff is near, No, The sheriff is a nig-- I ain't got no body And nobody cares for me He's out of his mind. -Richard Pryor, he did his own thing. -They both did great, obviously... ...but I can only imagine, if they would have done another one? Janeane's called 1 5 times. -Hello? -Hey, baby. Where have you been? I've been calling you for the last three hours. I know. I'm sorry. I had the phone off. I was in this Mel Brooks marathon. I've never laughed so hard. I gotta bring you down here. -This thing is crazy. -Alan, I need you to listen to me. Your father's died. -What? -And I've been trying to reach you-- -What did you just say? -Your mother called here,,, ,,,a couple hours after you left, He died in his sleep, in his bed... ...and Mom's here with us now and she's very upset and she needs you. Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's dead? I'm sorry, baby. -Where are the girls? -They're with Mom on the couch. They're fine. -I'll be home as soon as I can. -Will you please hurry up? Yeah, I will. Everything cool? My dad just died. Died, like... -...dead? -Yeah. You wanna go get some breakfast? Charlie, my father just died. Yeah. There's a store that's gonna open up soon. Sells kitchen counters. I wanna take you there. -They got marble tops. -Charlie, my father just died. Yeah, yeah, I know. I wanna hang, though. Come on. Let's not waste all this Mel. We just got a good dose of Mel. Are we hanging? No. We're not hanging. Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese. Come on, don't be such a pussy. All right, does everybody see what it is? Here it is. At the bottom. See? Good look. Come on. What do you think? -Yeah. -Johnson? -Yep. -I'm Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman? Did I catch you at a bad time? Well, I just came back from burying my father, but other than that-- Cool. Let me just say up front, Alan... ...I make it my business to watch this guy's back. -That's what I do. I look out for him. -Okay. Now, obviously, I can't stop him from doing this... ...without going down a very dangerous legal road. But rest assured, I'll do anything short of that... ...to not give you a million dollars. I don't know what you're talking about. He wants me to give you a million dollars. He has that kind of money? That's none of your business. That's my business. It's what I do. We've already established that. I won't let him be manipulated. Sugarman, calm down, okay? I don't want his million dollars. Tell him I'm not mad at him and we're still friends, okay? Just tell him that. -You're being straight? -Yes. I don't need his million dollars, okay? Just tell him that. Okay. I like that. Okay, good, then I've done my job. Yeah. Good job. Come on in and have some food. Go ahead. Daddy, your friend is here. The one who acts like he's younger than JoJo. Charlie Fineman? Honey, don't be like that, okay? Don't judge people. That's not polite. Hey. I'm sorry about your dad. Thanks. I behaved badly that night. I know I did. All right? I'm sorry. And you wanted to give me a million dollars to make up for it? I don't have any friends other than you, Johnson. I got you something. -The River, -Absolutely. -And Quadrophenia, -Yeah. Another album you used to torture me with. Quadrophenia changed my life, Johnson. That's a nice gift. Too late to go for the million? -Hey, are you hungry? -Yeah. -Wanna get some breakfast? -Yeah. -Come on. -All right. Just me and you here? Hey, everybody... ...this is Charlie. Charlie... ...this is everybody. Come on in. These guys are staying? Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's staying. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. We're having lunch today. We're having Chinese. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. The last time you were in a dental office, anyway? Need to schedule you for a cleaning? Come on. Let's go get something to eat. You miss it? Miss what? -Nothing. Forget it. -What? What? Come on. Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it. No, what do you think I missed, being a dentist? Do you? Why? -Why what? -Why are you asking me? Are you trying to focus me? Is that it? Did they send you here to focus me? Yeah, you got me. That's it. I'm with the CIA... ...and this is Operation Focus Fineman. -Are you kidding me? -Better not be. Charlie, if we're gonna be friends, you have to be able to trust me. -Thought we were friends. -We are friends. That's why I can't pretend I don't know anything about you. Is that a threat, though, to not be friends? No. I'm saying friends talk about what's going on in their lives. You're an asshole. Charlie-- Hey, Charlie! What the fuck is wrong with you? Get out of here, man! Charlie, get the f-- Okay, okay. Get out of here. Get out of here. Leave me alone! All right? Charlie, get out of here! Yeah. All right. Shut your mouth. What are you still doing in here? I told you to leave. Because this isn't your office. I left! This is public property. -This isn't close to public property. -Yes, it is! -Get out of here, man! -I'll call the police if you don't leave. -It's okay. Let me handle it. -No, it's not! He's-- Melanie, shut the damn window! Jesus. We can't keep doing this shit, Charlie. Look, I don't know what I said to you in there that got you so pissed off... ...but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right? All right. -Jesus. -I know. -Dr. Johnson. -Miss Remar. -Is everything okay? -Oh, yeah. Everything's good. -I have an appointment scheduled. -Just check in with Melanie. -Maybe I should come back. -No, no, it's fine. Just check in. Check in with Melanie. The one who--? Doctor will see you in the office. That gorgeous girl wants to blow you? -Charlie, come on. -She wants to blow you? -Look, get out-- -Come here. Are you crazy? Get out of here. -She's gorgeous. -Yeah, I know. Way you were talking about-- Thought she was a beast or something. -I gotta straighten this out. -All right, but how hot is that girl? -She's fine. She's hot. -She's the hottest. -Is she not the hottest? -Charlie, will you get out--? Let me go in for you. Let me get the blowjob. -Let me see that woman. -Oh, you're playful now? Get out. Stop it! Get out of here! Did you smell that? She even smells good! Jesus. -I wanna know what is going on. -Nothing is going on. -Don't tell me nothing's going on. -Calm down. -Let me explain it, okay? -All right, explain it. She's like out of a 1 940s movie. Did you see that girl? I mean, that was just perfection. You okay? "Okay"? No, I wouldn't use that word. Well, thank you for seeing me. Did I have a choice, Miss Remar? I mean.... You've really put me in a terrible position here at my office. Can we just cut to it? I don't wanna take a lot of your time. Yeah. This letter... ...that you sent my-- I can do this quick. Wait a-- No, no. Please. Recently, I've come through a rotten divorce. I was married for 1 0 years. My husband was having an affair for five of them. They had another life here in the city. He had two lives. I was walking down the street one day and I saw them. And I followed them, and it was truly like a dream. I spoke to a neighbour and she talked about them... ...as if they were the Joneses living next door all these years. And in that moment, I lost my equilibrium. And I fell, right there on the sidewalk. And the thing is, Dr. Johnson, I haven't yet gotten up. Now, my behaviour towards you is inexcusable, I know that. I behaved in a way I don't normally behave. What I've done by even threatening a lawsuit is so repulsive to me. I even lied to you when I told you that my therapist... ...had told me to act on my thoughts. I wanted to come in and see you and tell you that I am so sorry. And that I am very embarrassed. And that you won't be having any more trouble from me. -I promise that to you. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I'll go now.
