By senior year, I had it covered, or so I thought. I had a great guy, sights on college, art school... and a dream of life beyond. - Good morning, Arthur. - It's a decoy, Arthur. The AK-47's in her backpack. Yeah, right. You tell yourself to count the days and put up with the shit. You tell yourself these people are illusions, passing scenery. Hey, snap these, babe! They were nothing to me. I just use them for my art. No blading in the hall. I don't want to have to tell you again! - Okay,jockstrap sniffers, say cheese. - Action. Look out! Coming through! Most of all, I avoided the snares, skating past the obstacles... the way everybody who can manage it does. Guh-ding went the little green frog Guh-ding went the little green frog one day And his eyes went aggh-aggh-gung Okay, hold these suckers down on their backs. Ready for surgery. Nail 'em good. Last year we had one of these ribbits jump off... during the incision of a pulmonary vein. It weren't pretty. - What is it, Rita? - I can't do it. - Flake. - Get off her shit already. Hello, Rita. Take the scalpel. Earth to Rita. It's so defenseless. Frogs, they don't have feelings like we do, Rita. But their cardiovascular system is an excellent model for ours. In other words, their little hearts work a lot like ours do. Young man. Young man, stop when I'm talking to you! What class should you be in? But then something happened, unexpected. I felt it before I knew it. Excuse me. If you're new, please take a seat. I'll get the paperwork later. If I'd known you were coming, I'd have ordered you a frog. Where were we? Class, let's concentrate on the frogs. On the frogs. Let's start slicing, and this ain't pizza. Watch it. Let's all show Rita we can do this. Okay? Rita, are you with us? Take the scalpel now. We've been working on this for three weeks. We're holding things up. Let's not waste any more time. I'm gonna count to three and you'll take the scalpel, okay? One. Two. Three. Hey, let's do it! - No, I can't do it. - Come on, let's go. I can't! - We're gonna talk in detention then. - No! - Class, anyone else having a problem? - What's the deal with detention? He's always giving her shit. He's such an asshole. So make him stop. - Okay, I'll do it. - What? I'm gonna do it, all right? All right, class, you hear that? Rita's gonna do it. That a girl. Way to go. She's now aiming it at the point of incision. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing, young lady? Hey, I'm talkin' to you! - I'll see you in detention also. - I don't even go here. It wasn't over. I could feel it... like a charge in the air before a storm. What else does he do? He... he gets really close... and he touches my chest. - What's going on? - Rita's making up shit about Buttinger. I'm not! Okay? I'm not! He gets behind me... and he rubs himself on my ass. - You should be glad someone does. - Shut up, Cindy. - She's crazy. Everyone knows that. - She's telling the truth. He does it to me too. You don't count, Violet. You do it with everyone. Well, at least I know what I'm doing. - If half the stories are true-- - Give it a rest, Cindy. Look. You're the assholes for letting him get away with it. No. You're the asshole for letting him get away with it ! Excuse me. Who the fuck are you? You're all assholes. Because when that son of a bitch puts his hands on her... you should tell yourselves he's putting his hands all over you. Or you, or you, or you! Because he sure as hell would if he could. So what are we supposed to do? - Make sure he never does it again. - How? - We stick together. - Gimme a break. So, are we together? Good. We're just gonna sit here until we learn something about the heart. You know, Rita... you have very little confidence... for someone with so much potential, talent. What is that? What is that over there? You're very pretty. Pretty and talented aren't the same. What? Says who? That's where you're wrong. You know, you just don't appreciate your value as a woman. You know, I think you're way ahead of all the girls your age. I forgot my notebook. Well, get it. What are you doing here, Madeline? - What is going on here? - Don't let us stop you. - Go on with what you were doing. - Pervert! - Come here, Red. - That young lady is in detention today. We need to talk. - Keep your hands off Rita. - And Violet. And whoever the fuck else you do this to. - How does that feel? - Fucking little punk! That's right. You better move. You better keep moving. Or what? This is outrageous! This is absolutely outrageous! I'm a teacher! Madeline. Madeline! Come on! You don't believe Rita. She's emotionally unstable. - I'm not unstable! - I didn't mean it like that. I'm not unstable! Leave her alone! Stop! If you ever put your hands on me again... I'll snip your little nuts off with my toenail clippers. All right? This is great! Buttinger's such a fuck! All right, let's go. Let's go. Get out of here. Go! Come on. Can you get up? Next time you think about fucking with some young girl... you think about this first. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What if someone saw us? Oh, my God, what are we gonna do? - We should get the hell outta here. - Oh, my God, we're in trouble. -Just stay calm. - We are in so much-- Who was she, anyway? I think we should all go somewhere together. Does this bitch always talk in exclamation marks? We should all just go home. This is gonna be what it's gonna be. ''If you ever put your hands on me again... I'm gonna snip your little nuts off with my toenail clippers.'' I said that? The dork! Shit. - Maddy, sweetheart, did I scare you? - No, no. Get in here. - Hi. - Hi. Okay. Come in. Thank you. Spica in Virgo. AJune sky. - How did you get here? - I climbed. No. I mean, how did you find my house? You dropped this. Sorry, it's wet. It's okay. Do you have a dry shirt or something? I'm really kind of wet. - Yeah, yeah, sure. - Thank you. - So where do you live, anyway? - Mostly in my head. I'm just passin' through. - That's not very safe, you know. - I look in their eyes. If I don't think it's safe, I don't get in the car. - How can you tell? - It's a question of really looking. Mad, pick it up. Look, I heard what happened. - Is that your boyfriend? - Where are you? Just call me. I love you. Here, put this on. Thank you. - So where do you go to school? - Don't. I was thrown out. - For what? - For thinking for myself. So tell me about Buttinger. Is that his name? God, I have never done anything like that in my whole life. Rita Faldes isn't even my friend. None of those girls are. That's what's so weird. Well, she is now, for life. - Do you mind? - No, no, go ahead. There's some beef jerky under that pile. I can get you some. It's okay. Do you mind if I sleep on your floor tonight? Yeah. Are you sure? Good. - Good morning, hon. - Yeah. Are you gonna eat that? I was thinking about it. Yeah. Did Ethan stay over, Maddy? It's only a girl. - Who is she? - She doesn't believe in stairs? - Who is she? - She's my drug dealer. Thought I lost you. - I don't even know your name. - She says the next morning. - Don't worry. You're not my type. - Oh? What's this? That's my art stuff. It's a camera. Legs. What about 'em? That's what people call me. I vault without poles. That sort of thing. What are you doing? Come on. You're gonna fall. - I'm not watching this. I'm not. - Come and get it. - I'm afraid of heights. - Oh, how afraid? Are you this afraid? Does this scare you? Come on, Legs. If it was that important to you, you'd come get it. - I wanna puke! Come on! - Come on up here. Dance with me. - No way! - Come on. Oh, boy. Don't worry, I'll get it. Don't worry. Legs-- Don't! Come on. Oh, God. Careful! Legs, it's not worth it. Yeah, it is. You don't-- It's okay. Oh, God. Give it to me. Almost. Okay. - Easy. - It's okay. You're a frigging lunatic, you know that? God! - So is this good-bye? - It depends on how many bottles I find. Figure I need $50 before I move on. Nine hundred and eighty bottles to go. I hope you don't find all the bottles you need today. Look, there's a house about a half mile or so up the river. It's abandoned. If you needed a place to stay, I mean. Thank you. I gotta go. I'm late. Don't take any shit. How could you just do that and not tell me? - Because it's not about you, Ethan. - Why didn't you go to Mr. Parks? If Buttinger did that to you-- pressed you against the blackboard, grabbed your balls, what would you do? - That's different. - How? It just is, Maddy, and you know it. All right. I'd kick his ass. Where were you last night? I called. I passed out early. Come on. Live dangerously. Walk me to class. I'll be your substitute for the next few days. Mr. Buttinger is out due to a minor accident. Are you Madeline Wirtz? You're wanted in the principal's office. This note was intercepted between two students in class. Is there any truth to it? It says we beat up Buttinger. - Things got out of hand. - So it's true? - He grabbed me. - So she busted his nose. What? - He was sexually harassing Rita. - And you. This is a very serious charge. What are you girls? Some sort of gang here? Girls who run with foxes? That sort of thing? So you find this funny. Okay, I am going to suspend you all for two weeks... for your conduct in this office and for assaulting a teacher. I will have you escorted out. Mr. Parks, I need to stop by the art room, please. - I don't think so. - My application goes out tomorrow. - You should've thought of that before. - That isn't fair. - Two and a half weeks. - What about Mr. Buttinger? - You leave that to me. - He should be fired. Three weeks. Would you like to keep going? - It's all my fault. - Yeah. Why don't you kill yourself? - Why don't you just drop dead? - Savage wit. Don't you get dizzy constantly looking down on her? I can't go home. My parents will kill me. We can go to my house and watch TV. TV sucks, man. It's lame. I know where we can go. Mr. Parks, this is Rita's mother... and I'm very concerned about the situation with Rita. You do a lovely mommy. Maybe you will call him for me? Sure. I'll do it better on the phone. - Good. - Where the fuck are we going? I'll call your parents too if you want. Yeah, whatever. Isn't it beautiful? Bet it's haunted. I bet the ghost that I saw when I was little is still here. You saw a ghost? Really? - I saw a UFO. - Did you really? Whoa! There's a tree in here! We can build a tree house. So I hear you got suspended. For thinking for myself. Then cheers. Get away from me! I just found it. We all got suspended together. Mr. Parks is such an asshole. Yeah, he wouldn't let Maddy get his ar-- her art. It's my portfolio. - It has to go out tomorrow. - Then we should get it. - What do you mean? - We should go to the school and get it. If there's a utility hatch on the roof or basement, we'll go in and get it. If I got caught, I would be in so much trouble. - She took that risk for you. - Yeah. I'm down for a felony. - A felony? - This is way risky. We could be like dead gerbils up here. This is where they put the bad kids. I need to get outta here. It's not funny. - Where's the thing? - We're gonna get lost in here. - We're gonna die. - Here it is. Here it is. Thank God! This is so weird. - I can't do it. - Come on. Guys, please don't go anywhere without me. We're not going anywhere. We're right here. - Oh, fuck. - It's okay. Come on, Rita. You can do it. - Oh, good job! - Good girl. Come on! Don't you like flashlights? I always wanted one when I was little. - Hand this to Violet. - Not like a normal flashlight. Like one that would suck up the darkness like a vacuum cleaner. Shut up already. I gotta get my stuff. I only knew how to draw one thing in art class: a penis! - Okay, here. - Calm down. Just put the stuff in there. One more. One more. - Did you hear what I said? - No, was it funny? Okay, here it is. Okay, I got 'em. I got everything. I got 'em. I got 'em. I've got one more, though, so wait. Great, okay. I got 'em, I got 'em. Front door! Front door! Let's go. - See if you get it. - You got it. - Got anything? - Not yet. Okay, I got you. Shit! This way, this way! This is Simon. There was a small fire in the art room. Over. Yeah, it's probably a chemical reaction to something. Copy that. Over. Did you see-- - I wonder what happened to them. - I found more candles. You and your fucking weed. You're a tea head. Where were you guys? We need more candles. Where'd you get all these candles? - Look, it's a shrine. - Where'd you find these? Was it laying around in this house? Probably like witches here. - Crazy shit. - That's right. Oh, my God. - What are you doing? - Check out her pouch. I'm commemorating tonight. This is so I'll always remember tonight... and you, Maddy. And Goldie. And Violet. And Red. - Fire? - Because it nourishes... and also destroys if you don't respect it. That's how we were tonight. Do it to me. Hold still, okay? Don't be scared. Oh, my God. Is it done? It's beautiful! I love it! We're like those girls who run with foxes. You're such a geek! We're like those geeks that run with foxes. I'm a runaway geek, goddamn it! We're supposed to do our portfolios. You forgot? No, I remember. I just don't have mine. It's not at my house. - What's up? - Hey. What is this? It's a-- I got a tattoo last night. - You're pissed. - No. I'm happy that you beat up a teacher... got a tattoo, stood me up. Hit your head or something lately? What's the deal? You should just do your portfolio and get it in. I'll do mine alone. We're hanging out tonight, right? Why do you keep doing this? Are you some kind of freak? What is the matter with you? Don't you have any respect for yourself? This room looks like a drug den. I want these candles out of here before you burn the whole house down! We're going to be late. So, we'll be at the medical convention in Miami. Remember? The number's on the fridge. Don't forget to feed the bird. Oh, there's a girl or whatever to see you. Honey, you want me to stay home with her? She's 1 7. She's old enough to take care of herself. I gotta pee! - What's that? - It's nothing. It's a cut. Would you just get out? Get out. Get out! - Get dressed. We'll be late for school. - I'm getting a ride... with a friend. She doesn't have any friends.
