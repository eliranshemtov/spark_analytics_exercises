- Dum-da-dum - What's this? - Um, Annie made them. - Who's Annie? Thank you, Lillian. From La Rosette? She's only the most famous pastry chef in America. Um, this is orange, made with real Seville oranges. - Oh. - And, uh, that's lemon on a mille-feuille crust. I don't like cake. It's for the party, Dad. Ah. The goddamn party. The goddamn party. Mm-hmm. - Did you hear that? - I'm sorry. The goddamn party. Oh. - Come on, l... - Here, let's try this one... right over here. - Mmm. This, this is terrific. It has, um, has vodka in it, Bill. - A little vodka, right? Has, um, that fruity vodka, that flavored stuff, right? Bill, put your lips around this. It's just out of this world. I'm sorry, honey. You know, I'm no good at this. Why don't you choose whichever cake you'd like? - Hmm? - I knew you were gonna say that. - What? - I mean you just don't care. Oh, why am I doing this? I should have my head examined again. Oh, my God. I am trying to throw the party of the century... For my father in two days. - And you just don't give a shit. - He gives a shit. - He doesn't give a shit! - He does. - Allison. - He does give a shit. Don't you, Bill? Come on. Come on. - Come on. Smile. - I'm sorry. But what should we tell Annie? - Bum-bum-bum This one. Mmm. - He gives a shit! Fantastic. Thank you. Um, Mr. Black, would you care for a piece? Yes, I'd love one. Have you had a chance to, uh, look at my father's rare books? He has Jefferson's parliamentary manual, and, uh, this first edition of Bleak House. I love your smell. Well, I like the way you smell too. My mom always used to say that you could set your heart by that clock. Could you? I never tried. Till now. - Joe? - Hmm? May I kiss you? Why, yes, you can. Mmm. Thank you. You're welcome. - Joe? - Mmm. I don't know who you are. - I'm Joe. - Mm-hmm. And, uh, you're Susan. Mmm. And... I have this... weak feeling in my knees. - And is your heart beating strangely? - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - Faster. The taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue... that was wonderful. Mmm. I should, um... I should go home. Mmm. Shouldn't I? Yeah. - Good night, Dad. - Good night. Hello, Bill. Hello. Would you like to join me and Allison and Quince for a nightcap? No. Not right now. Okay. Then I'll say good night. Good night, Bill. - Morning, Quince. - Top of the morning, B.P. - Hello, Quince. - Hey! - Hello, Jennifer. - Good morning, Mr. Parrish. - The board is waiting. - What? - The board? - Didn't you call a board meeting? No. - Good morning. - Morning, Bill. Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill? I don't think so. Do you? To get to the point, we've received new information from John Bontecou... concerning his desires for this company to merge with his. And we wanted to set the details before you. - Is that it? - Bontecou wants a quick response, and... The answer is no. Quick enough for you? - Don't you want to hear the details? - I'm not interested. I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am interested in... is how my board got convened behind my back... and is entertaining a further proposal from a man with whom it offends me to do business. I made a decision. Case closed. So am I to understand from your response... that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer? Yes, you are to understand that. And now, may I ask you a question? - Certainly, Bill. - Are you running this board, or am I? That's it? We've got a busy day ahead. This meeting's already set me behind. - Shall we adjourn? - Before we do, Bill, while we're here... There's a second question the board would like a response to. Far simpler one. Who is the man standing to your left? I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all. But who is he? What are his credentials? What is his relationship to you? The board is deeply concerned. We have reason to believe Mr. Black is not only influencing your decisions... in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you. The lack of response, Bill, is not appropriate. We are your board. We have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company. And, most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you. Okay? One more time. Who is Joe Black? A motion has been brought before the board... to invoke Article 19 of the corporate charter. In English, please. Mandatory retirement on our chairman's 65th birthday, at which time the chairman will be named emeritus. You're welcome to attend all meetings... and will serve as international spokesman for the corporation. Plus, of course, a settlement, a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground. Please indicate your vote by a yes or no. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. Yes. - No. - No. Motion's passed. We will, of course, delay the announcement out of respect for our former chairman... until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend. Well, thanks for allowing me to save face, Drew. The other motion before us is the acceptance of John Bontecou's offer... to merge this corporation with Bontecou International. Okay. Joe? Who I am... and what my relationship is to William Parrish... will be divulged in our own good time. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Black. It's not over till it's over. Please, Eddie, no "fat lady sings" stuff. I still sense some doubt in this group. We could turn it around. - You'll be up in the country? - Yeah. The big celebration of my mandatory retirement birthday. - You're an honored guest, Eddie. I'm gonna stick it out here. We still have a shot. Get John's office on the phone. Tell them I'll be there in 20 minutes. What did you do? - You've gotten the old man fired. - That we did. Thanks to you. He was wobbling, mind you, but you supplied the coup de grace. I'm gonna put a stop to this. Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs. I-I didn't mean to do this. Train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard. Now, would you like to hear the silver lining? Check that. Gold. Once John Bontecou acquires Parrish Communications, he's gonna break it apart, peddle it piece by piece to the highest bidder. That was the game plan right from the start. I set it up for him, and he smacks it out of the park. Ramifications for you? You'll be farting through silk. You'll sell your stock. You'll be positively, truly rich. You can stop kissing ass. What'll it feel like to be a man? - I'm going to expose you. Okay. Go right ahead. You tell William Parrish how you betrayed him in a secret board meeting. Tell Allison how you helped her father lose his company. It's just life, Quincie. Wake up and smell the thorns. You're here. I am. I, uh... just dropped by. I thought I'd scrounge some lunch. I was in the neighborhood. I'm so glad. When I called, they said that you and Dad had already left the office. Mm-hmm. He's taking a nap. Oh. Yeah. Well, uh, he must be tired. You know, this whole Bontecou thing... It, um, seems... Yes, he's tired. I believe so. Yeah. You must be hungry then. No. Not anymore. Are you? I loved making love to you. It was like making love with someone... making love for the first time. Thank you. Do you like making love with me? Yes. More than you love peanut butter? Yes. - Much more. - Where are you going? - Nowhere. I'm here. For how long? I hope a long, long time. Me too. What do we do now? Um... it'll come to us. Hello, Bill. Did you have a nice nap? - I couldn't sleep. - I'm sorry to hear that. I'll come down. What's going on? Hmm? I saw you kiss Susan. Yes, I saw you see me. You're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman. - I'll be the judge of that. - I'm her father. With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission. You goddamn well should! You walk into my life. You give me the worst news a guy can get. You have me dancing on heads of pins with my business, my family. - Now you're spooning with my daughter? - "Spooning"? Yes! And stop repeating everything I say and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around and God knows what. Oh, you arrive on the scene... Why you picked me I still don't understand. I chose you for your verve, your excellence... and your ability to... instruct. You've lived a first-rate life, and I find it eminently usable. What do you want? Huh? Everybody wants something, Joe. You've been taking me from pillar to post here. And, uh, I thought I knew who you were, and it wasn't a lot of fun. But it was almost bearable. But now I'm getting something else from you, something very... very strange. What is it that you want? I'm only living the Parrish bywords... looking for that "ounce of excitement," that "whisper of a thrill there is no sense living your life without." You know what I mean, Bill? You're violating the laws of the universe. - This universe? - Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe, but I know who you are, and you're all fucked up. I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references. And I don't give a shit. Perhaps it's time to remind you this is not simply a dispute with a putative suitor. This is me. So be careful, Bill. Cut all that "Bill" crap out, you son of a bitch. I'll say it again. Be careful, Bill. Can I help you? Excuse me, can I help you? Yes. Dr. Parrish, please. She comes on at 6:00. Oh. Hi. - Where's Joe? - Joe? Joe's not around. - Do you know where he is? - I don't know. Oh. Why are you looking for Joe? Love. Passion. Obsession. All those things you told me to wait for. - They've arrived. - This is crazy. Why? A man shows up, almost never leaves your side. Well, you clearly trust him, depend on him. So why aren't those things good enough for me? - You don't know anything about Joe. - What are you afraid of? That I'll fall head over heels for Joe? Well, I have. Just like you did with Mom. Isn't that what you've always wanted for me? Susan... I don't think Joe is gonna be with us long. Where is he going? I don't know. - I can't say. - Oh, come on. The guy's working with you. You know chapter and verse about everyone working with you. In this case I can't. L... I only will tell you that with Joe, you're on... very, very dangerous ground. I love him. I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you! Joe's no good for you. Of course not, Daddy. I'm sorry. I love you too. Mr. Bad News. 'Bout time you show up. Don't be feisty, sister. I'm not feisty, mister. You come for me? That's good news. No, I come to see the doctor. - Doctor? - Mm-hmm. - What could be wrong with you? - Nothin'. Ohh. You come to see doctor lady? - Yeah, man. - My doctor lady? Mine too, you know. You're in love? You're loved back? She know your real self? - She know how she feel. - Backside! What the hell kind of business this is. Don't need you okayin'. Schoolboy things in your head. Badness for you. Badness for her. Badness for me, lyin' here, tumor big as a breadfruit, poisonin' me inside, and waitin'. Bring you flowers, and all I's gettin' is aggravation. The only flowers I want to see... is the ones over my peaceful self resting in the dirt. Can't do no right by people. Come to take you, you want to stay. Leave you stay, you want to go. Rahtid. You're not in your right place, mister. Me neither. No more. Take me, and you come with me now. But I not lonely here. Somebody want me here. Hmm. It nice it happen to you. Like you come to the island and had a holiday. Sun didn't burn you red-red, just brown. You sleep, and no mosquito eat you. But the truth is, it bound to happen... if you stay long enough. So take that nice picture you got in your head home with you, but don't be fooled. We lonely here mostly too. If we lucky, maybe... we got some nice pictures to take with us. You got enough nice pictures? Yes. Good-bye, sister. Yes? I have the feeling, all in all, what I made this voyage for has served its purpose. What are you saying? It's time to go? I'm ready. You are? Yeah. Good. Tomorrow. After the party. - Yes, Helen? - Telephone call, sir. - Mr. Sloane from New York. - Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Hey! Hey. Red or white? - No. No, thank you. - Have a drink. - You look like you need one as bad as me. - I do? - Quince? - Mm-hmm. I find myself a little confused. - Confused, huh? - Yes. - About what? - Love. Love. Oh, man. I got problems of my own. - You love Allison, don't you? - Yes, I do. How did you meet? Well, um, I was this world-class loser, and she was this happy little rich girl, and for some reason she took me in. But Allison loves you. How do you know? Because she knows the worst thing about me, and it's okay. - What is it? - No, it's not one thing. It's just an idea, Joe. It's just, um, um... It's like you know each other's secrets, your deepest, darkest secrets. - Deepest, darkest secrets? - Yeah, and then you... you're free. Free? You're free! You're free to l... love each other completely, totally. Just no fear. So there's nothing you don't know about each other, and it's okay. Hmm. - Do you like me, Joe? - Oh, yes, Quince. You're one of my favorites. What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish? Oh, I told Drew and the board that Bill depended on you. Drew and Bontecou are gonna chop up the company, sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside. Drew was Mr. Inside. And I was the fool who made it all happen. Ohh... God. What do I do? Go to Bill Parrish and tell him the truth. He'll forgive you. - You think so? - Yes. You think I should wait till after the party? No. No. Four down here and a sturgeon up there. This one is perfect. Absolutely. Okay, I think I want four here like that... - Hi, Daddy. - Hi. - What do you think? Well, it's, uh... it's starting to grow on me. Oh, I've got a baritone with a balalaika... coming from the Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt, and he'll be singing Nelson Eddy songs. Wow. You really are amazing. But why, oh, why, Allison, are you doing all this? I do it because I love you. Everybody loves you: Mommy, wherever she is, Susan, Quince... all the people you work with, anyone who's ever met you. Ohh, Daddy. After all, you've been a wonderful father. Yeah, well, I haven't been the father to you that, uh... - That you've been to Susan? - I wasn't going to say that. But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay. Because I know that you love me. I mean, it's not like it is with her. Whenever she walks into the room, your eyes light up. She always gets a smile from you, as opposed to me. When I walk in, this look comes over your face, like, "What does she want now?" But you've never let either of us want for anything. Oh, God. More than that, Daddy, more than that. I've felt loved, and that's all that matters. So, never mind favorites. You're allowed to have one. The point is, you've been mine. Oh, Allison. Oh. I really feel... I've everything I could've ever wanted for my birthday. Oh, wait a minute! There's more to come. Lots of excess, like you love. You know, this is gonna be a wonderful party. Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you. - Happy birthday! - Thanks. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Good evening. - Thank you. - Hello. - Welcome. - Hi, Susan. - Hi, Simone. How are you? - Hi, darling. - Oh, hi, Gene. Hi. My father told me you might be leaving. Your father and l... Our time together has come to an end. I'm in love... with a man, but I don't know who he is, where he's going or when. I can tell you the when part. Tonight. So it does get worse. No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman who... I don't wanna leave. I don't wanna leave. Ohh. Then don't. There's so little we know about each other. There's so much I should tell you. That'll come. That'll come. - Will it? - Mm-hmm. I wanna be with you, Joe. I opened my big mouth one too many times. Everything just got all, uh, twisted. It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well, and I appreciate that. - Sometimes things just turn out wrong. - Yeah? - Excuse me. - No, no... Uh, Joe, come in. Um, I wanna thank you. Is it okay, Bill? - Sure. - Joe knows the whole story. I told him. And it was his idea that I come clean. I mean... I wanted to come clean, but, uh, he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean? Yeah, I believe I do. Anyway, uh, I can see you guys got business. No. However, I do have some unfinished business with Drew. Get him on the helicopter. Get him out here tonight. I wanna tell this guy how I feel about him face-to-face. That could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt if Drew is anxious to see you face-to-face. - I'll deliver the package. - Okay. - How are you doing? - What the hell do you care? Just asking, Bill. You wanna know? I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who is not walking through the valley of the shadow of death. He's galloping into it. At the same time, the business he built... with his own hands and head has been commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. Oh, yes! I almost forgot. My daughter's fallen in love with Death. And I'm in love with your daughter. Say again? I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight. - You what? - I think you heard me, Bill. You're not taking Susan anywhere. What does that mean, anyway? We had a deal. And I'm sorry. Susan's my daughter. She has a wonderful life ahead of her. You're gonna deprive her of it, and you're telling me you're sorry? I'm sorry. Apology not accepted. I don't care, Bill. I love her. How perfect for you... to take whatever you want because it pleases you. That's not love. Then what is it? Some aimless infatuation which, for the moment, you feel like indulging. It's missing everything that matters. Which is what? Trust, responsibility, taking the weight for your choices and feelings... and spending the rest of your life living up to them, and above all, not hurting the object of your love. So that's love according to William Parrish? Multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I'm talking about. - Those were my words. - They're mine now. Bill, Susan wants to come with me. She loves me. - She loves you? - Mm-hmm. Who is you? Did you tell her who you are? - No. - Does she know where she's going? Huh? You see, Susan went for that poor son of a bitch... whose body you took, and everything since has been aftermath. You don't know what love is. She doesn't know who you are. You make a deal; you're breaking it. Bottom line is, Joe, you're swindling her soul, and you're doing it with your eyes wide open. - I don't like what you're saying. - I'm past caring what you like and don't. - You're stealing my daughter, and I'm not gonna let you. - You're not? - No. - Are you threatening me? Yeah, I certainly hope so. Yeah. I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now and every minute in between. And what I dream of is a man who will discover her, and that she will discover a man... who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, this time... and has the grace, compassion and fortitude to walk beside her... as she makes her way through life. Enough! What I know is what I want, and what I want is Susan. And I will have her, and she will have me. And that's the way it's going to be. And there's nothing you can do. Why did you tell me all this, Joe? You're the big shot, the biggest shot of all. You don't have to ask permission, but that's what you're doing. Do you know why? Because you've somehow developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong. I don't know what you're gonna do, but, uh, how can this be love? She doesn't know who you are. Why don't you tell her, try it out, see what happens? Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may. Okay? I've given it my best shot. I, uh... I wish I could tell you to sleep on it. Oh, um... I'm sorry. Would you excuse me? - Sure. - Okay, nice to see you. Nice to see you. There's something so indescribably sexy... about you standing in the middle of a crowd. I could make love to you right here. You're trying to tell me my future, you're looking on the wrong side. There is something I do want to tell you. But you can't? Just now when you hesitated, I got a chill. Remember that morning in the coffee shop? When you said, "What's wrong with taking care of a woman? She takes care of you." - Did I say that? - Mm-hmm. And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that these days. Well, you found one, Joe. The coffee shop. That was the place, and you were the guy. And you said that, uh, that you didn't want me to be your doctor because... you didn't want me to examine you. Why, I got to examine you, after all. I could come with you. You want me to wait? You'll come back? May I kiss you? That felt like good-bye. What's going on, Joe? I feel like we're lifting off. I'm still here. But you're not. You're somewhere else. You're someone else. Don't you want to ask who? - Yes, but... - "But"? Joe, I'm afraid. Afraid to find out? Don't be. It doesn't matter what I am. You know who I am. You're... You're... You're Joe. Yes, I'm Joe. Oh. And I promise you... you will always have what you found in the coffee shop. Tell me that you love me. Tell me that you love me now. I love you now. I'll love you always. Susan. Yes? Thank you for loving me. We should think about getting started, Bill. Mm-hmm. It'll just be us. Thank you. - Bill? Come in. I got him. The helicopter will be here in two minutes. How are we on time? Okay. Get him in here. - May? - Yes, sir? - I know you're busy, but I want you to put in a call to Eddie Sloane for me. - At home, sir? - No, he's at the office. This is damn big of Bill. - Ooh. You all right? - Yeah. Also smart, you know? Well, he had no choice. He knows you're a formidable adversary. - He said that? - Yeah, I mean, you got him by the short hairs. Yeah, the short and gray hairs. - We're all here, Bill. - I appreciate this, Eddie. Members of the board, this will just take a minute of your time. As custodians of the company, you may receive information from what follows... that will be valuable to you or not. - Either way, thanks. - We're all ears. - Thanks. Good evening, Bill. Thank you, Quince. I just wanted to say how appreciative I am of this, um, grand gesture. Shut up and sit down. You're a useless sack of shit, Drew. You played footsie with John Bontecou... so you could dismember my company to line your own pockets. I don't know where you get that idea. The board agreed... The board didn't know you were a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all. Is this Mr. Black's fantasy? Another one of his whoppers? Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? Nobody knows who he is. But one thing everybody does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since. You're the poison, Drew. You've operated behind the scenes to suborn the trust of a man... who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class, elegance and stature. I've had the opportunity to be witness to every kind and degree of deception. But Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian... that it has rarely been my experience to encounter. And yet, he has combated them stoically and selflessly, without revealing my identity. Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier. He could have turned defeat into victory. But he is too honorable a man to have done that. Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation. So now, given these losses, I'm compelled to end the need for secrecy. The time has come to tell you who I am. So tell me. Tell me. I'm peeing in my pants. - And you're going to pee some more. - Joe, don't do this. It's okay, Bill. It's time we put this person in his place. It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's gonna step aside. - I'm not stepping anywhere. - I appreciate your gentlemanliness. But what we need to do here is drive the dagger home. - "The dagger"? - I told you to shut up! Prepare yourself, Drew. - L... - Joe, please. Kindly let me take it from here. - Am... - Don't. An agent for the Internal Revenue Service. - Bill? - Huh? Bill. - Bill. - Yeah. Yes, he's, um... He's an agent for the Internal Revenue Service. Mmm, yes, we were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, has structured his mergers and acquisitions... in suspicious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. The agency asked Bill for his cooperation in an undercover investigation of Bontecou. We wanted to go after him, and this deal gave us that perfect opportunity. - And I offered to cooperate. - And we're very grateful. Uh, Agent Joe Black here... Of course, that's not his real name... smelled out your involvement, Drew. He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, that is what is known as a conflict of interest. Undisclosed conflict of interest. - An offense. - An indictable offense. - And a likely conviction. - Very likely. I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer. No lawyers, Drew. Uh, we're gonna offer you a deal. Confess to the board every detail of your participation, then submit your resignation. What do I get? You get not to go to jail. You're talking through your hat. You're offering me a deal because you've got no proof. - Proof? We've got plenty of proof. - He's talking through his lips. Drew, make no mistake. Should you choose to test my resolve in this matter, you will be looking at an outcome that will have a finality... that is beyond your comprehension. And you will not be counting the days or the months or the years, but millenniums in a place with no doors. All right, you win. Soon as I get back to the city, I'll meet with the board. You're meeting with the board right now, Drew. Resignation accepted. Moreover, I propose a motion to reconfirm William Parrish... as chairman of the board of Parrish Communications, as well as a rejection of the merger with Bontecou International. - How say you, board? - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - The motion is passed. Thank you. That's great. But it's more than I bargained for. I just wanted to set the record straight. You have. Sounds like these guys want you back, Bill. We'll get their apologies later. Meanwhile, enjoy your party. Celebrate. I'll attend to the nasty details. And, Mr. Black, may we say thank you? My pleasure. This is an I.R.S. Agent's dream. I'll be promoted chief of section off this. Who would have believed it? You an I.R.S. Agent? Death and taxes. - Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear William Happy birthday to you - Speech! Speech! - Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Thank you. - I thought I was gonna sneak away tonight. - No! What a glorious night. Every face I see is a memory. It may not be a perfectly perfect memory. Uh, sometimes we had our ups and downs. But we're all together, and you're mine for a night. And I'm gonna break precedent and tell you my one candle wish. That you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say, "I don't want anything more." Sixty-five years. Don't they go by in a blink? Hi. Oh. What a night. I'm having a hell of a time. You were right... about Joe. He, uh... He is going somewhere. I'm sorry. You relieved? Yes, but... But what? I want you to know how much I love you, that you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, that no one can ever take from me. - Dad... - No! I love you so much. And I want you to promise me something. I don't want you to ever worry about me. And if anything should happen, I'm gonna be okay. And everything's gonna be all right. And I have no regrets. And I want you to feel the same way. I love you, Daddy. That's why it's okay. No regrets? No regrets. That's a good feeling, isn't it? Yeah. Everybody's saying good-bye. I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan? Yeah. If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me. Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old. Can I get you anything, sir? No. Do you have any peanut butter? Uh, I don't think so, sir. Mmm. Thank you anyway. You're welcome. What's that? The fireworks are starting. Let's go down and watch. - Shall we? - You go on ahead, honey. I'm just gonna catch my breath. Okay. Okay. Happy birthday, Bill. Thank you. Did you say good-bye? Not exactly. I guess you have your reasons. Yes. Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan? I've never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you. That's what I always wanted for her. But what happens to her now? I wouldn't worry about it, Bill. These things have a way of working out. Would you mind if I expressed my gratitude? For you, for the time you've given me, for the person you are. Don't blow smoke up my ass. You'll ruin my autopsy. It's hard to let go, isn't it? Yes, it is, Bill. Well, that's life.
