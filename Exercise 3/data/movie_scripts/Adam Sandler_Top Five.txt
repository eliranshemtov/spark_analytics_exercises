(Car horns honking) Andre:  I'm telling you, everything means something. No, everything does not mean something, okay? Sometimes a movie is just a movie. Sometimes a song is just a song, sometimes a joke is just a joke. Remember those, jokes? Yeah, I remember 'em. Okay. So lighten up. We have a black president now. A little bit. Just a little excited. Half black! Half black! And whenever something goes well in the country, the white people go, "oh, the president's doing such a great job." And then whenever there's a problem, it's like, "that nigga's ruining everything!" Nope. We are going to have a woman president next and she is going to be latina. Yeah? Ooh, okay. And she might even be gay. And we'll have an Asian president. Oh, a balanced budget. And we will have another handicapped president. Okay, hold on. We're not gonna have a handicapped president. We already had one. No, no. I'm talking about out-the-closet handicapped president. He was out of the closet. What is wrong... Okay. That... Hey, hey. Don't get me wrong. People knew that he was handicapped. No, I got nothing against the handicapped, but everybody's not as liberal as me, okay? The media wasn't better then. I mean, you "run" for president, you don't "roll" for president. Like, you'll "run" a campaign, you don't "roll" a campaign. You are horrible. I'm not horrible. That is sick. What is wrong with you? I'm the one voting for the Mexican lesbian handicapped president. (Scoffs) Oh, my God. You know what? People are more accepting now. it is literally rough for women, okay? But I am hopeful, because people are changing, okay? You need to wake up and smell the progress. No, no, no, no. You need to wake up, okay? Wake up and smell the progress. Nothing's changed. Yes! Black man trying to get a cab in New York City. Ha-ha. Watch this bullshit. Man: What's up, hammy! Black man trying to get a cab. Look at this! Ha, ha. Taxi, taxi! Taxi, taxi! Yeah. (Brakes screech) (Hip hop music playing) at this special edition of my program at this great university. (Audience cheering) In 2005,  time magazine voted today's guest "the funniest man in America." By 2010, the former stand-up had hit it big with a string of blockbuster movies, including  hammy the bear 1, 2 and  3. (Audience cheering) (Gunfire) Hammy: All right, Sanchez, here's the plan. I need you to get that box of guns across the street. We don't got time for that. (Gunshots) Sanchez, you got plenty of time. You got hammy time! Now go! It's hammy time! It's hammy time! It's hammy time! It's hammy time! When you were in school, were you the class clown? When's the next  hammy movie? (Audience cheering) Rose:  And after some run-ins with the law due to a battle with alcoholism... I mean, I was at this restaurant the other day, and I saw this guy drink half a beer. And I was like, wow, how the hell he do that? Do you think you're ever gonna go back to stand-up? (Audience cheering) I am past stand-up. I've done it. I had fun with it. Here's the thing. To me, there's nothing better than the first day your movie comes out, and sneaking into the back of a theater, and just watching people enjoy themselves. Did you lose your taste though for comedy? I want to make uplifting entertainment. I wanna make... Like  uprize? Like  uprize. I want to make thought-provoking entertainment. Opening today, you can see him play the Haitian revolutionary dutty boukman in his new movie, uprize. (All shouting) Rose:  And you can also see him getting married to reality star Erica long on bravo. (Crowd cheering) Hi! Benny: Look who's here. Hi, doll. Benny: Hey, beautiful. Hey, would you mind getting in on the other side of the car and then exiting this side? Please, it's for the show. Fuck you, Benny. I'm not on your show. No, you are on the show, you're just not getting paid. Guys, play nice, please. (Scoffs) I always play nice. It's not me. Mr. groom, baby, we are almost there. We've got three more days and then we're married. You happy? I'm happy. I'm just a little stressed out from this movie. That's all. Oh... Why are you stressed? Baby, you did great work. I know. I know. You murdered that role. Thank you. Thank you. Okay? Where's my kiss? Do we have to do this on camera? Let's just get off camera. Let's go back in the car. If it's not on camera, it doesn't exist. (Crowd cheering) Our thanks to Andre Allen! (Audience cheering) Crowd: (Chanting) Hammy! Hammy! You know, today's one of those days I feel like having a drink. Not funny. Don't talk like that. and I don't feel like getting you out of jail. Don't worry, no slip-ups. Hey. Thanks. You know, I can't wait to see the movie play in a theater later! It's gonna be packed. Oh. It's gonna be something else. I can't wait. (Chuckling) (Inhales sharply) Ooh, I love me a big girl. You moving with confidence. Mmm. Oh, by the way, Erica wants you to wear a red shirt on the plane, and when you get off, she will have a camera crew waiting for you. Camera crew, red shirt. able to find me amongst the sea of niggas getting off of private jets? Okay, whatever, man. Let's move on to the next interview. Next interview? I thought I was done until xm and the junket. Well, Charles just texted me this one. They need you for a few hours. (Indistinct clamoring) A wyclef movie is hard to sell. Everybody in the barber shop wants to see you in that bear costume. They love you in that bear costume. You gotta wear it, baby. Yeah, but they can't even see my face. (Laughs) But they feeling you, son. I told you, I don't feel like doing funny movies anymore. I don't feel funny. We talked about this. Save some of that stuff for your  times interview. Times? Fuck the  times. You act like you've never had a bad review before. I could take one, but every one? "Every one," really? Come on, man. Look at this shit. "Andre Allen is the most pathetic character "in cinema today." "If he ever put out another movie, "I would not see it "if it was playing in my glasses." Why the fuck would somebody say some shit like that? That's James nielson. That's what he does. He's a critic. And he won't show his face. No, fuck James nielson. He's been ripping my shit apart for years. The next one's a chick. She just wants to do a profile piece on you. And I think she's a big fan of yours. Fuck the  times. You're gonna do this, okay? I'm not going to go back and forth with you about this. We talked about it. It's  the New York times. Do you hear me? The New York times! that movie crossbusters, what'd I say to you, Andre? that little baseball movie, what I say to you, Andre? You said it wasn't a good idea. Now, when you tell me you wanted to do that movie about the Haitian revolution, Andre, what'd I say to you? You said it wasn't a good idea, okay? No. No, no, no, no, you're wrong, Andre. That's not what I said. I said, "nigga, is you crazy?" I emailed it! I sent the email out with a bunch of racial slurs and bad English to my own company account! The reason why I did it, Andre, was 'cause I wanted to be on file to show people that I was against this! I was against this project! I... I jeopardized my job. You know that? I almost ruined my job. What are you talking about? A nigga can't get fired for saying "nigga" to a nigga. You've never been more wrong. A nigga can... A nigga can get fired for saying "nigga" to a nigga. A nigga don't run this damn company. Matter of fact, if niggas at this company found out that I was using the word nigga in here, my black ass would be on the street. I guess you're right, nigga, but I don't want to do this. I hate the  times. Everything I do, they trash. Look, Andre, they're gonna write the story anyway. And I mean, it's hard enough getting you a job as it is. I mean, it's not like everybody's knocking on your door for work. It's really hard to get you work. You know that, I know that. Are you kidding me? Listen, Andre, the wedding is the best thing that you got going right now. And let's be honest. Andre, if this thing flops, we could be talking dancing with the stars, man. Dancing with the fucking stars? Yes.  Dancing with the stars. That's where you're at right now. is follow you around for one day. Let them follow you around! You know, if I get the word out, this movie could still be a big hit. It could be like a Haitian django. If you say so, Andre, then yes. Hold on. Hold on. Hey! Hey! Hey! What is going on? Where's everyone running to? Zoolander's in the conference room! Ben stiller's in the conference... These white people don't tell me shit! Yo, silk! Where's the car? It's in range. Hey, how'd it go with Charlie rose? Chelsea brown. From the  times. Yes, from the  times. How'd it go? I thought you were supposed to be watching. You a real journalist, or like miss Detroit? Funny. Look, they just told me that you're gonna be doing this. I'm sorry if I'm late. Congratulations on the wedding. And the movie. You know, some friends and I saw you a few years back at purchase. Thank you very much for doing this interview. Why, 'cause your boy James nielson said he wouldn't watch my next movie if it was playing in his glasses? James. Hey, who would have thought Google would have made that possible, right? Look, you're about a half hour late. If I were you, I would get started. Okay. I just need to go home first. They just told me that we were doing this. I don't have my recorder. Recorder? What are you, Lois Lane? Just use your phone. No, you don't understand. I... I can't do an interview without it. It's kind of my thing. I'm sorry. You take these? Chelsea: Uh... Yes. Andre: They're good. Chelsea: I do photography on the side. I do a little poetry on the side, I do a little music on the side. That's nice. It's always good to make sure you never get too good at any one thing. Chelsea: Okay, I'm almost done. I just need to change really quickly. I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend for his birthday. A word of advice. Never surprise anyone. Chelsea: Why? Hey, I call my mother before I go over, 'cause I don't want to walk in there one day and catch her hugging up on some other kid! Hi. Are you going to marry princess Erica on TV? Can I see your phone? Did you have a baby when you were 10? Chelsea: Don't take his phone. Mom? Okay, what are you doing with my phone? Playing  angry birds. But I don't have angry birds. You do now. Grace? Go finish your work,  mamita. And give the man back his phone. Hi. Hi. I'm Gladys, Chelsea's mother. Are you ready for the big day? Oh, the wedding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're so lucky you found someone. I hear that being a cougar is a big thing, but I can't find anybody that wants to be couged. So, I read this stuff to try to better understand men. Listen to this. "Men love it when you gently..." "...lick their..." Okay, no more  cosmo. Wait a minute. I thought you wrote this one. Wait, wait, get out of here. So... so you are a real journalist. Gladys: I'm sorry, I didn't know it was a secret. Shakira Simmons? (Stammering) What's that? Your stripper name? Shakara Simmons. I don't use my real name for the Fluffy stuff. Okay, I found my flip, and we can go now. So what's up with all this cinderella stuff? (Elevator bell ding) Um, those are my daughter's. A little girl's reading the cinderella effect. Okay, that one's mine. Okay. Don't you think it's kinda odd that a grown woman is still into cinderella? that a grown man is still into the Yankees? Yes, but the Yankees are a real team. A-rod is real? Okay, you got me on that one. And for your information, my daughter is working on a school project. You know, where they have to rewrite a classical story and she's doing one on the real cinderella. According to my child, cinderella was born a nanny in the Bronx in 1995, okay? Her mama was a nanny and her secret father was the mean white landlord, Cinderella had to do all the things that a nanny has to do, she had to cook and clean, and do everything for her sisters. And then one day, prince came into town and was doing a concert that everyone wanted to attend. But the landlord forbid her to go, so she waited until her sisters left, and then snuck into the concert and was the prettiest girl there. Prince didn't want to hang with anyone else, and then she noticed that her sisters were leaving and she knew she had to go. But she also knew that she wanted to see prince again. So, she did what girls do when they want to see a guy again. Hand job? She left something. (Elevator bell dings) Man: (On radio)  Only two days until the wedding spectacular. The jury's still out on which shoes Erica will wear. So were you the class clown growing up? Class clown? Is that why we went back to get this recorder, so you can ask me if I was the class clown? Look, I am really sorry to break it to you, but not everybody knows your origin story. You know what? Why don't you just skip the hack questions and go right to something good? All right. Good questions, huh? (Inhales) How come you're not funny anymore? And what's up with this wedding? I mean, it seems really out of control. Who the fuck are you? You don't know me. Are you my agent? You had your kid so young you guys share math class, and you're judging me? You're asking me if my relationship with my fiancee is real. Yes. (Cell phone buzzing) Wait, hold on a second. It's my career move. (Cell phone buzzing) Oh, go on. (Beeps) Hey, honey. Hey, baby. What's going on? Yeah, no. I'm here at the place. And it looks sick. It's like epic, babe, it's epic. It's a story. and I'm looking at head shots of flower girls. Whoa, she's got buck teeth. Is my stand-in as nervous as I am? Oh, stop it. Everything looks just great, okay? I just wish you were here to see it. It's going okay when they ask about the movie. Baby, don't worry about what they're saying. Your movie is way over their heads. No, not yet. I'm running a little late. Silk: I look bad, you look bad. Salesgirl: Champagne, Mr. Allen? Are you gonna drink that, Mr. ankle bracelet? I always say yes. 'Cause whenever you say no, people want an explanation. Yeah, I'm the same way with meth. I just take it. Is it true that Erica helped you get clean? Do you even know what my movie's about? It's about dutty boukman, a self-educated slave who, once in Haiti, became one of the leaders of the revolution where Haitian slaves killed over 50,000 whites. Yay, dead white people. Dutty did not shut up and play nice. You know, normally, after someone says they saw your movie, they give you some sort of opinion, you know... They go, "oh, I saw your movie and I thought it was good." And you know, sometimes they don't like your movie and they go, "I saw your movie and I thought it was interesting." Yeah, it was interesting how you ended the movie before you showed how the French had cut his head off But I'd like to ask you this question first. How do you think being sober has affected your career? It hasn't. Uh, I think it has. I know it has. I mean, really. What do you know about sobriety? What do I know about sobriety? Uh, what don't I know? "God grant me the serenity "to accept the things I cannot change... Both: "...The courage to change the things I can "and the wisdom to not smoke crack." Yeah. Yeah. Is that more research, or are you in recovery? Four years. Four years? I'm four years. I drank everything, it didn't matter. It got really bad when I started guzzling hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer? Whoo! Did you ever drink sterno? What the fuck is sterno? Yeah, sterno, you know those little cans they put at the buffet to keep food warm. That's some Amy winehouse shit. Can we get back to this idea that your sobriety hasn't affected your work? Did Erica actually get you clean, as rumor has it? No, I got myself clean. You need to stop listening to rumors. Man: Hammy! What got you clean, miss sterno? I don't know. Um, my mother. My kid. Maybe I just got tired of waking up with strange dicks in my face. Ho! Whoa! Whoa! Too much info. What... Okay, your turn Mr. "I got myself clean." Rigorous honesty? Yes. You guys rip me apart every chance you get. Why should I talk to you? I've got nothing to do with that. Yeah, but that's your people. Look, if you're gonna just cut my head off and parade it around the square, I don't need to help you with that. I'm not here to hurt you. I just want a decent story. You give me a couple of really great honest things, stuff you haven't told everybody else, some real inside stuff, rigorous honesty stuff, and I promise you... I will be more than fair. On the record. On the record. Deal. Nice to meet you, Andre Allen. I look forward to interviewing you, Andre Allen. Okay, let's try this again. First truthful question. What was your bottom?

I think she dealt with it. Hey, excuse me, sir. No, no, no. Oh, I just wanted... Mr. Allen, hi. Um, is there a problem with your ring? Well, there's another ring there. Ah, you're right. I mean, we're just getting married, we're not winning the super bowl. Miss long came by earlier this week and, uh, added onto the order. Added to the order? Man 1: Hammy! Man 2: Hey, yo, hammy!

No, I'm fine. What's on your mind? Ask me a question. Interview me. Get in my business. That's what I'm trying to do. What happened? Okay. Let me ask you a question. If a guy you loved gave you a wedding ring, a ring you said you've always wanted, would you exchange it because your boss told you to? Why'd you change the rings without talking to me? Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I meant to tell you. I've been so busy, I just forgot. How does that make you feel? I didn't say it was me, I just said if a guy you loved... So this guy I love... Which ring did he get me? The network, those jerks, they just thought they weren't camera-friendly enough, if I thought there was gonna be a problem. She's a reality star. Everything's for sale. Everything's not for sale. Okay! You ready? What's up? This is Andre Allen and when I listen to satellite radio, I listen to Sirius hits one. That's, um, that's good, just, uh... Just make it a little funnier. Funnier? You're a funny guy. Make it more funny. Okay. Hey, wassup, this is Andre Allen and when I listen to satellite radio, I listen to Sirius hits one! Just, you know, say... Just put a little, uh... Put a little stank on it. Stank? Stank. Stank. Stank? Give it stank. Okay, I don't really know what you mean. Uh, could you show me? You're the funny... I'm not... okay, all right. It's like... Hey! This is Andre Allen, and when I listen to satellite radio... whoa! I listen to Sirius hits one! Whoo! It's a brand new movie. Uprize? Uprize. Uprize. It's in theaters today. You're playin' a Haitian revolutionary? This is a... Homosexuals. ...homosexual radio station. Yeah. I just want to say, "what's up?" To all my Haitian fans that listen to opie and Anthony. that hammy the bear is a revolutionary out of Haiti? Hammy's not in the movie. They should let children out of school to see this movie. They should show it in school. First hundred gay people get three dollars off their tickets. If you look at my comedy, it was always serious. Just prove your gayness... How do we prove we're gay? ...And we... I have some, uh, some goat meat. I brought you some, uh, Haitian food. Goat meat. Goat meat? Spaghetti with ketchup... Cumia: (Laughs) What is... ...which Haitians actually eat for breakfast. Cumia: Wow, really? Yes. This... this... Yes, spaghetti with ketchup is the cheerios of Haiti. (All laugh) Now, is there going to be a  hammy the bear 4? Andre: I hate hammy the bear. I gave you three hammy the bears. I want people to take me serious. I want people to stop walking up to me on the street and making bear sounds. Andre, what do you have to say to the white audience here that is insulted, uh, disgusted, by your movie, watching 50,000 of their people being killed? Uh, George Bush kills a lot of brown people. Nobody had a problem with that. Cumia: It wasn't a movie. He killed some... Like, really killed them! Cumia: Oh. I fake-kill white people and it's a problem. How many of these white people actually die on screen? Uh, probably two, three thousand. That's it, dawg? Stank. Stank. Nice and funny. Go! Wassup, motherfuckers? This is motherfucking Andre Allen! And when I listen to satellite radio, or scratch my nuts, that is, I listen to Sirius motherfucking 101, biatch! First take was good. I was wrong on the stank note. First take had a lot of wonderful stuff in there. Andre: I hope you're writing nice things about me. Let's go. (Horn honking) Man 1: What's up, dawg? Man 2: Hammy! Man 2: Hammy, don't get brand new. Carl: Hollywood. Hollywood! Holly, hey, holly! Hollywood! Get... Get your ass over here! (Laughing) Look at who's... Look who's slummin'! (Laughing) Come here. Come here, boy! Hollywood! Hollywood! Roll out the red carpet. There it is. Hollywood, come on, boy. (Laughing) (Stammering) What you... I thought you'd be in L.A., you know, getting ready for that big wedding. I see commercials for it all the time. Yeah, yeah, I'm in town just doing some press for this movie. I leave tonight. Uh, Chelsea here is doing a story on me. Hello. Oh. So I see. That's why you bring your ass around here. What, you telling her how bad you had it? Is that what it is? Huh? (All laughing) Oh, come on, man. You're coming to the party, right? Some people got to work. I'll tell you what. I'll come to your next bachelor party. (All laughing) It's not funny, man. Hey, tell me something. Your next wife, is she going to be, uh, white or she gonna be Asian? (All laughing) Still not funny, man. Oh, it's only funny when you say mean shit, right? You know what? What? Imma get out of here. I'll catch you later, okay? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Come here, come here. Come here. Um... Look, can you break me off a little something? I haven't got my check... Haven't cashed it yet. (Exhales) Here. Really? Thanks. I'll put it on your tab, okay? Thanks, Hollywood. Thank you, Hollywood! (Laughing) Hey, nice meeting you. Hey, don't you believe a thing he says, okay? (Laughing) Hollywood! Damn! Who was that? My father. Man: Hammy! Woman: Yo, hammy! You don't even know what celibacy mean! Oh, my gosh! Hi! Andre! Yo! Look what the cat dragged in! Akil, give your Uncle a hug. Hey, man, what's up? Aw, shit, hide the liquor. God damn it! Hide the liquor? Look who's talking. Hide the crack. (All laughing) Yo, homeboy, well, that wasn't necessary, man. That was the '80s. Either you was using or you was selling. Either way, you got swept up in it. Hey, man, I'm being nice. I didn't mention that five grand you owe me. When I get my income tax check, you're gonna get yours off top, my man. You know what, you gotta have a income first before you get a check. You can't tax zero. Is this come down on Fred day? Yeah, he's allergic to jobs. He takes job Benadryl. Just take it. When he feel a job coming on, he just take a Benadryl. (All laughing) Hey, everybody, this is Chelsea brown. She's doing a story on me for  the New York times. Now, she's gonna ask a few of y'all some questions. Feel free to answer. But remember, no snitching! All: Oh! Oh, you must be out your mind! You want me to be quiet, you gotta clear the five thousand, my man. I said five thousand to be nice. When it come to me, baby girl, I'm gonna turn over like a apple pie. You know what, you just ate a apple pie, you fat motherfucker. Shut up! (All laughing) Fred: Can I say something? Jealousy will get y'all nowhere! I watch Erica's show every week. I can't wait to see the wedding. When you gonna bring her around here? Soon. That's what you said last time. And you know what, I'm still waiting on my invitation. Hey. I'm not in charge of the guest list. Okay? Tell the truth. Tell the truth. That bitch don't like me. No, she likes you. She asks about you. Oh, she asks about me? She asks about you all the time. What does she say? She say, "how your big friend doing?" Lisa: My big... Is that what that bitch think about me? I'm big like that? For real? I'm just saying. That's that Hollywood shit, Andre! That's that Hollywood shit! I'm just playing. I'm just playing. Why I ain't got my invitation? Well, 'cause... (Stammering) 'Cause they figure we could, you know... the hotel... Andre, you're full of shit right now. And the airfare. Everybody's coming to the bachelor party, right? I want to, but general tao over here... I said no, 'cause he don't know how to come home and shit, making it rain... We need our fucking ones. (All laughing) Put that down and have a fucking seat. I mean, come on, there's gonna be a TV crew there. Erica picked out everything. They're even giving out gift bags. Gift bags? Nigga, kill yourself. What's wrong, man? What's wrong with a gift bag? They got lots of cool shit in there. Fred: Nigga and gift bags. (All laughing) He's a corny-ass nigga. All right. I got another five grand. What you got? All: Oh! Can I get one of them gift bags? (All laughing) Hey, bro-bro, check this out. I got the new jawn. The 2016 jawn. It's real light. Matter of fact, if you take it off, you won't even sweat. I can take yours off, too, if you want me to. Nah, that's okay, but thanks. Nigga, put your bracelet back on! I don't want the cops running in here! Me? I was there first time he got on stage. Chelsea: How was he? He sucked. Nothing about him was funny. He was like a bag of dead kittens. Son, when nas focus, he better than Jay, man, I'm sorry. Lisa: That's some real shit. Fred: 'Cause Tupac was headed for the Oscar. Or Tupac would be one of our political leaders. Tupac might be a political leader, if he was alive. But then again, Tupac might be in a Tyler Perry movie right now. So you don't know. You don't know. Fred: You never know. He might be... Tupac might be the bad dark-skinned boyfriend in a Tyler Perry movie. I gotta agree with that shit right there. I would hope he's a senator. But he might be kicking Jill Scott down a flight of stairs. (All laughing) Fred: Yo. Dre. Yo, dre! Chelsea: Who was the funniest? I think I was the funniest. I'm tight funny. Yeah. Chelsea: Yeah? You ever do any stand-up? Nah, nah, I'm like, you know... I'm not stand-up funny, I'm just, like, the funny dude. Like, you know, put me in a scenario, and I'll go buck wild. I always been funnier than dre! When my ma's water broke, I was funny. She went into labor, she wasn't crying, she wasn't screaming. She was laughing! The doctor said, "what's wrong with her?" She said, "I'm having Fred." I'm just saying... I'm just saying, if it don't work out with me and this nigga, I'm gonna get me a white man. Chelsea: Do you ever think about how different your life would be had you stayed together? It just didn't work out. I broke up with him. (All laughing in distance) Yeah. I'm happy where I'm at. But you must think about it sometimes. Every fucking day. I mean, girl, I used to get mad at him for playing playstation. What kind of shit was that? If I'd have known how successful he was gonna be, I woulda built him my own playstation. Dre ain't funny. You know who's funnier than dre? Nick Cannon. That motherfucker hilarious. Put your top five... Who's your top five? Slick Rick, Kane, rakim, krs-one, and biggie is my fifth man. And Jay z is my sixth man. Chelsea: Would you write any jokes for him? Yeah, I would, I would, but, see, everything up here with mine. My top five is Jay, nas, scarface... Scarface, 'cause everybody got their shit from scarface. Rakim. Lisa: Rakim. Rakim, and then I might let biggie get in there. Once his mother died, man, it changed a lot. He ain't even wanna be funny anymore. He was like... He was a different dre. Lisa: My top five. Ice-t... Andre: Ice-t? Ice motherfucking t! ¶ Six in the mornin' police at my door ¶ fresh adidas squeak across the bathroom floor ¶ we started drinking young, man, we was like 12 years old. We used to get o... O.E. Cans, and cut 'em out and make gold teeth out of 'em. My sixth man's ll cool j. (All shouting) Before the show! Before the show! (Fred laughing) He was funnier drunk. Everybody's funnier drunk. You ever see Oprah drunk? She's hysterical. Once he stopped drinking, once the nigga stopped getting oddy with the 40s, something was gone, like, 95% was gone. This nigga was bugged out. You think he funny now? You should've seen him in the pissy staircases. This nigga was hilarious. Dre, if I get married, man, I'm gonna do the suge knight speech at my wedding. "If y'all don't want the preacher "all up in the wedding, "the ring boy all up in the wedding, "come to death row!" Good morning, buffalo! Wassup, San Antonio! This is not another hammy movie. And it's about the Haitian revolution. The greatest slave rebellion of all time. Slave rebellion. It's when slaves rebel. Uh, taraji p. Henson, uh, Gabby sidibe, uh, Anthony Anderson. I play a guy named dutty boukman. Yeah. Well, I've been... I read up on him, and I've been wanting to do this movie for a long time. Yeah, I just found the story fascinating. (People laughing in distance) Yeah, well, this is the kind of stuff I'm trying to get into now, more serious stuff. Yes, it's fun for the whole family. It's educational. Watch this dunk. Commentator: He splits the defenders... Yeah, yeah. It's about the Haitian revolution. Yeah, the Haitian revolution was the largest slave uprising in the Western hemisphere. Andre, I know this party's gonna be crazy, so if we don't get to talk to each other, make sure you call me back. All right, now, if my husband answers the phone, don't hang up, 'cause he knows what time it is. Now come here, give me a hug. Aw. Hey, dre, stay black, nigga! Keep it one hundred! You heard? Don't forget where you came from, son! (Cell phone beeps) "I'm texting my boyfriend" look on your face. What's his name? Brad. So what's he do, Brad? He's a d.J. He spins at greenhouse on Monday nights. So, how old's he turning again? Thirty. Thirty. Hey, man, 30's that birthday. I remember when I turned 30. 30's scary. You know, 30's that age where you realize, "I gotta get my shit together. "I could actually become homeless." I mean, not will-Smith- pursuit-of-happyness homeless. I mean, like blow-job-in- the-bus-station homeless. So, that's what you think? He's deep in thought right now about not being homeless? If he's smart. If he's not, he won't think about it till he's 40. Then it'll be too late. (Crashing) Oh! Silk: You okay? Driver: Is everybody okay? My apologies. Out! Let's get out. Let's get out of here. Silk: Gotta go. What the hell? We can't just leave. Silk: Let's go, go, go. Chelsea: What are you doing? Silk: Let's go! Andre: Come on. So, what, you're just leaving the scene of an accident now? Andre: I didn't have an accident. My driver had an accident. But if the person that hits us finds out I was in the car, then they will sue me. He's right in front of me. Not now... not now, ma'am. I hope your dick falls off! Silk: Where's Ralph at? Get him over here right now. You know, if he wasn't clearing a path for you, I'm sure she wouldn't even have noticed you. Is he always so bodyguardy? "Bodyguardy"? That's a word? Jay-Z is seen walking around by himself all the time. Yeah, but Jay-Z's got a fucking gun, okay. That's silk. That's my boy. We've been together for, you know, since third grade. He's seen a lot. (Heavy rock music playing) (Both grunting) You think it's a game? I'll kill you, motherfucker! You think it's a game? (Andre yelling) I'm not talking about firing him. I'm just saying, this is New York, and only people who wanna get paparazzi roll with their bodyguard all the time. But if you're too scared to talk to me one-on-one without your bodyguard, your little security blanket, I completely understand. Hold on a second. Okay, I got a new car coming. It's gonna be about an hour, though. We should hop on a cab and head back over to xm, and finish up all our west coast satellite stuff. You know what? I'm good. Just... just meet me over at the junket, all right? What do you mean you're good? Hey, Brad. It's me, um... I'm gonna walk. Outside? Yeah. It's a rough neighborhood, you're gonna walk around by yourself? You got an interview in 20 minutes. Hey, man, I'm good. Just text me the information, okay? You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm good. It's supposed to rain. I got an umbrella right here. I'm all right, man. Woman: Silk, don't act like you don't know me. If you need me, text me! I'll text you! What's up? Angie: It's Angie. He's scared I'm gonna need him. No. He's scared you're not going to need him. Andre: It's staring you right in the face, all right. Every  planet of the apes movie is about race. Every one. about the trilogy that starts off with charlton heston frolicking naked with a black astronaut. That typical Sci-Fi movie that's about the future and about how the human race is out of control. Yeah, it's about race, but the human race. No, no, no. It's about the white man's fear of a black planet. The darker apes are bigger and stronger. The lighter apes are smarter. That's racist bullshit. Do you realize that the original planet of the apes came out on April 3, 1968? Now, we both know what happened the next day. Martin Luther King was killed. (Kids chanting indistinctly) Chelsea: Why don't you just jump in? You're telling me that James Earl ray saw  planet of the apes and decided to shoot Martin Luther King? It wasn't the fact that he was organizing the poor people's march on Washington... That, too. ...Or criticizing the war or our foreign policy. What got him shot was talking apes! Kids: Go, hammy! Go, hammy! Girl: Go in! Chelsea: Jump in already! What I'm saying is, it's not a coincidence that a movie about niggas taking over the world comes out the day before the most powerful black man on earth is assassinated. It's not a coincidence. It's not. You actually believe that. Okay, you know what? I will give it to you. There are some subliminal messages in that movie. Yes, there are. But you know what? It's just a movie. It's never... It's never just a movie. Yes, sometimes it's just a movie. It's never just a song! It's never just a book. I don't care what Michelle Obama says. I'm like, fry or die. Give me some fries. I thought you didn't want none. Fry or die. Now, do you always keep hot sauce in your bag? Yeah, I like my shit hot. In my apartment, I keep a bottle in every room, like smoke detectors. Kids: Hammy! Hammy! Hammy! Hammy! Girl: Jump in already! Andre: Come on, hurry up! Man: Hey! Chelsea:  Bill Murray? Andre:  Bill Murray's like, you know, perhaps top three funniest human beings to ever walk the earth. And the guy you most likely want to hang out with and drop his name, like, "yeah, I know bill Murray. "I was just talking to bill Murray the other day." Charlie chaplin? Charlie chaplin. He started this shit. He's the krs-one of comedy. The krs-one. He's the grandmaster flash of ha-ha. I don't think people actually read capote. That's one of my tests to people. I say that and they're like, "oh, yeah, "you know, I really loved breakfast at Tiffany's." And I'm like, "you haven't read Truman capote. Stop." Bill cosby is the greatest storyteller. Richard pryor? Richard pryor is like the most honest human being. Even Jesus didn't tell his followers everything. Eddie Murphy. I once saw Murphy and Michael Jackson within two months of each other, and Eddie was better. And he says, "too much love is as bad for this as no love at all." Yeah, I mean, it's hard to fuck somebody on a pedestal. (Chelsea laughing) (Girls cheering) (Indistinct chatter over pa) (Chiming) (Camera shutters clicking) Man 1: Beautiful. Taraji! Man 2: Andre! Man 3: Gabby, over here! This way, Gabby! Man 4: Hammy, this way! Woman: Andre, over to the right. Man 3: Big smile, Gabby. (All talking at once) (Whispering) Married. (Chuckling) You're getting married, huh? You couldn't tell me? Man 1: Can I get you two to smile? Thank you. Thank you very much. Man 2: Taraji, this way. (Indistinct conversations) How can you keep your private life separate from your public life when you're going through something this weekend which combines the two? Your upcoming marriage is getting more press than this movie. I mean, I'm watching, like, television... Everybody's talking about that. Nobody's talking about this. What kind of ratings do you think you're gonna get? Okay, you got two minutes, everybody. Two minutes. Do you think they only wanna see you... You maybe stereotyped yourself that people don't wanna accept you in a serious role? We want to see you funny. I already told you. I ain't got time for your bullshit, silk. I'm seeing somebody. Hey, no problem. Come on. If you don't get the fuck out my face... (Sirens wailing in distance) Chelsea:  How do you think it went? The press was all over the place. I'm just glad they showed up. I mean, honestly, the most important thing right now is that people come out and see the movie. You mean, the most important thing isn't the  "wedding spectacular spectacular"? I did not say that. Okay, so you don't wanna be funny. Woman: Excuse me. So, you don't wanna make funny movies anymore. And they don't want to take your "serious" seriously. I'm sorry. So why not embrace the wedding spectacle? I'm a guy, come on. I didn't grow up dreaming of a wedding. There's no  grooms magazine. They don't have a groomal registry. Weddings aren't for guys. I'm not talking about guys. I'm talking about you. Why don't you embrace it? If you hate it so much, why are you even doing it? Erica helped me get clean. I don't have time for this, dre. I'm not gonna be your audience. "I'm not gonna be your audience"? Audience to my bullshit. If you don't have an audience, it's hard to put on a show. Brad? Hey. Hey. Happy Birthday. Oh, my God. Thank you. Chelsea: How are you? I tried calling you all day. I was so worried. Yeah, yeah... No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Uh, I was just in meetings. Oh, hey, Andre Allen! Hey! White Brad! Happy Birthday. Thank you, man. I'm so glad somebody's finally telling boukman's story. I mean, no one talks about the maroon slaves. I know, they're so overlooked. It's crazy. It's crazy. Okay, so what have you been doing all day? Well, it's my birthday. You know, I've been treating myself. Uh, went uptown, did a little shopping, didn't find anything. Chelsea: What are you doing here? I just was, like, going to check out the gift shop. 'Cause you never know... Chelsea: Is that Ryan? Yeah, Ryan's here. Hey, Ryan! Ryan, look who I ran into. Hey, Chelsea. How's it going, guys? Um... I'm also here because Ryan, uh, was just showing me the lounge here because he knows the manager of the hotel and he's thinking maybe I could be spinning here soon, so... And that's why you couldn't contact me? My phone is, like, going nuts lately. I don't know what's going on. I'm changing plans. Is he wearing the shirt that I bought you? I have to go. (Sighs) How much longer are you guys gonna be doing this thing? I think you should go after him. Look, it's hammy! (Car honking horn) Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you okay? Yeah. No. I'm... I'm going to call my sponsor, okay? I'm sorry. Just because he had a room key and was wearing a shirt you bought Brad, that doesn't mean anything. I mean, guys trade clothes in hotel rooms all the time. Maybe it was chilly, you know what I mean? Maybe they called up each other... "Hey, man, I'm freezing." "Uh, me, too. Why don't you meet me at a hotel "so we can switch clothes?" Shh. Kelly? Can I... I need to talk to you. Please. Thank you. Great. I can say I've dated every race, and now I've dated gay. Asian? Yes, Asian. Karate Asian or nerdy Asian? Asian-Asian. You know, there's a billion Chinese. I think it's proven that their dicks work. Yeah. I've dated married. I've had a girlfriend. Two girlfriends. Okay, so you can go all k.D. Lang, but if he's with one guy, he's gay. Whatever, I don't make up the rules. Who cares? It's not about that. That's not the point. You know, stuff like this doesn't come out of the blue. There must have been some sort of sign. I'm not gonna tell you. Come on, tell me something. I'm not telling you. Come on, teen mom. Let it out. Okay, so we had a normal sex life. (Brad grunting) Then one day, out of the blue... Put a finger in my ass. I didn't want to do it. Like, this was not my thing, and luckily, no one had ever asked me before, so it never really came up. But he asked me. And then my grandmamma popped into my brain. (Speaking Spanish) I like your grandma. Chelsea:  So I did it and he liked it. (Moaning) (Laughing) Oh, yes. That's it. Chelsea: Like that? Yeah, yeah. to be doing something he liked. But then he wanted it all the time. Everywhere. On a plane. Go another knuck. Knuck it up, girl. Knuck it up. Chelsea: Yeah? Yeah? (Brad grunting) Chelsea:  At my friend's party. Brad: Yes, yes, yes! What's my motherfuckin' name? Jigga! (Grunting) Chelsea:  Pretty soon, that's all he wanted. So one night, we're at dinner with Ryan and his "girlfriend." So, chels, you've been looking for a place, right? What's been going on with that? Yeah. I'd like to buy a house, you know, but everything's still so expensive. I thought the market was down. Babe, are you kidding? With your credit, you couldn't get a loan if bill gates cosigned it. (Laughing) Good one! Hey, Alexa, how's your place down in Costa Rica doing? Wait a second. You got a place in Costa Rica? I felt completely humiliated, but it was, you know, just let it go. It's not a big deal. You know, you're bigger than that. You got a babysitter. We can have make-up sex. It's gonna be fine. (Both moaning) (Brad chuckling) Oh. What? What? I have to go to the bathroom. Okay. All right, go, go, go. Go. I think it's dance night, baby. You ready? You know I am. Come give papa what he needs. Chelsea:  I looked at his ass, just stuck up in the air. And I thought about what he did. Good one! (Laughing) If bill gates cosigned you. Chelsea:  I don't know, something just snapped. I reached into my purse and pulled out a tampon. Then I pulled out my hot sauce. No, no! Don't say it! Chelsea:  And I... Chelsea:  I shoved it up his ass. Oh! (Grunting) (Screaming) What is that? Yup. Brad: Why? Why? Why are you doing this to me? Take it out of here now! Hey, smartass, I don't hear you laughing now! He's such an asshole! Andre: What are we doing? (Sighs) You know, grace really loves him. Like, a lot. And then he's just gonna be gone. (Indistinct conversations) What am I supposed to tell her? Just tell her the truth. I mean, you don't want her to think she's supposed to stay with some guy out of some false sense of obligation. She's gonna see her mom fall down and then she's gonna see her mom pick herself back up. No, what she's going to see is her mom having paraded yet another dude through the house who's a loser! Oh, my God. My favorite. My favorite. (Inhaling) You're right. I'm just going to have to start the process again of vetting another dick. You're not gonna have a hard time meeting anybody, come on. I mean, you're smart, you're beautiful. I'm really not fishing for compliments right now. No, no. I'm serious. I am, too. You're beautiful. You know that, right? Can we get out of here? Andre: (Laughing) What happened after that? What, you just went to brunch after that? Yes, as a matter of fact. We didn't even talk about it. I thought we were breaking up, but apparently not, you know. And that's why I've been feeling so guilty, and trying to figure out what to do with his birthday. Oh, come on, he's not gonna break up over that. Why not? 'Cause what's he supposed to tell people? "Yeah, we broke up 'cause my girlfriend "shoved a red hot chili pepper up my ass." No, no, no. He's gonna wait to do something like cheat on you or hit you. You know, like, a nice respectable break-up. Hit me? Hit me? Not... Something respectable like cheat on me or hit me. So basically, what you're saying is that you're taking his side. Awesome. I'm not taking his side. I mean... Clearly you are. Come on. Come on. I can't believe you didn't see this shit. I mean, he was wrong, okay? He was wrong. But he wasn't burning-ass wrong. See, that's why I didn't want to tell you. I open up to you and you laugh at me. It's funny. It's not funny! What's funny about being cheated on? about cheating, then you're very naive. (Laughing) Naive? I'm naive? Wow. Mr. "oh, the network picks out my rings." Mr. "oh, I owe somebody a wedding." Oh, okay, first of all, you don't know me... Miss "I used my boyfriend's ass as a hand puppet." Yeah, yeah. I don't need to know you to know that something is wrong. Why do you even care, okay? Why don't you care? Can we just talk about my movie? Fuck your shitty movie! (Chelsea moaning) (Music playing in club) We should stop. (Banging on door) What the fuck are we doing? (Both panting) We gotta get out of here. Yes. But first... What? You gotta get your hands out my pants. You gotta get your hands out of my pants. You first. You first. Okay, on three. Okay. At the same time. Same time. Okay. Same time, motherfucker. Both: One, two, three. Ooh. Goddamn. Okay. Uh... We should get out of here? Um, yeah, yeah, but you go first. We can't get out of here at the same time. Okay, I mean, you know... Remember, nothing happened, right? Yeah, like, just because we didn't fuck it doesn't mean that we didn't fuck around. So you go first and then I'll come out in a couple seconds. A couple minutes. Okay, so I'm going to get out of here. Okay. I gotta make a call anyway. Shit, my phone's dead. I gotta call fucking London. Um... Here, use mine. Okay. Code, 1999. Andre: Thanks. (Loud music playing) (Indistinct conversations) Yo, yo, silk. Man: You're hammy the bear! Yeah, yeah, have him pick me up at the coffee shop. Yeah, union square. Two iced coffees! Man 2: Hammy! (Indistinct conversations) Man 2: Hammy, I love you, man! (Cell phone chimes) Andre:  What the fuck? Chelsea is James nielson? Why, 'cause your boy James nielson said he wouldn't watch my next movie if it was playing in his glasses? James. Man 3: I love you, Andre! Man 4: Andre! Oh, my God, it's Andre Allen! When are you gonna do another  hammy movie? Your boss is looking for you. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You're James nielson. Were you going through my phone? I went through your phone looking for naked pictures. That's going through my phone. That's beside the point. You're James nielson. It's not what you think. You trashed me for years. And then you hang around me like you're my friend? I'm sorry. I've been wanting to say something all day, I just didn't know how. Oh, shut the fuck up. Now you're lying on top of your lies. I'm not lying. You're lying. I remember in one of your reviews, you go, "o.J.'S been brought to justice. "Bin laden's been brought to justice. "When will Andre Allen be brought to justice "for his crimes against humanity?" My mother read that shit. Man 5: Oh, Andre Allen. Chelsea: Andre? Man 6: Hammy! Chelsea: Andre. Okay, maybe I took it too far. You think? Yeah. I was so happy 10 minutes ago. Me, too. You told me you were in the program. I am. You're not in the program. I am. That's the truth. What do they tell you in the program? What do they tell us? "Rigorous honesty." I know. Rigorous fucking honesty. I know. You wanna know why I won't make any funny movies? 'Cause I never did it clean. Every time you ever seen me be funny, I was drunk or high, or both. Every time. Every show. I was fucked up. And now people want me to be funny. And you know what? I don't know if I can do it. And I'm scared. I am scared. Rigorous honesty. Benny: The wedding is tracking like crazy. There are no more ads to buy. You sure you can't talk him into doing a few more receptions? Mmm-mmm. No, I don't think so. But I'm pretty sure I can sell him on more honeymoon stuff. Don't worry. I'll get him on board. Benny: How's the movie tracking? (Scoffs) Andre: So, what's the line for? Woman:  Boo. What's that? Oh, it's the new Tyler Perry movie. It's where madea gets trapped in a haunted house. It's doing great. Man: Yo, hammy! Good for him. So, how am I doing? (Speaking other language) (Man yelling) (Machete swishing) (Man grunting) So how's it playing on the other screens? This is the only screen it's playing on. (Speaking other language) Stop here. (Sighs) Yeah. Hey, yo, man, you mind if I get a picture with you real quick, man? I'm a big fan of your movies. I love all of it, man. Not right now, man, not right now. Come on, let me get one picture with you. Hey, what's that? (Speaking Spanish) Hey! Andre: Hammy the fucking beer? Fuck you, hammy! Hammy the fucking beer? (Tires screeching) (Siren wailing) No! Officer: I need you to relax. Andre: Get away from me! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (Indistinct shouting) Officer: Come on! (People clamoring) Prisoner 1: Hammy! Prisoner 2: Wassup, ham? You saw me, man. You heard me. Hammy! at a grocery store in Manhattan. Benny: Out, please. Thank you. Can we clear the room, please? Quickly, thank you. Thank you. Man: All right, let's go. Erica: Dre? Hey, hey. Erica: I cannot believe you did this to me. Are you kidding me? Right before our wedding? Really? It is on CNN, fox, tmz, media fucking takeout! As soon as I get out of here, I'm gonna come right to you. No, no, no. You're not gonna come to me. You're gonna go to your fucking bachelor party! You can still make this right, dre. I'm an alcoholic. I'm a fucking drunk. Do you really think I need to go to a party? Erica:  You have to do this. Did you forget who the fuck I am? I turned down Bradley Cooper! Matt kemp! Matt fucking kemp! I could have had anybody! I chose you, dre. Everybody wanted to wife me, and I chose you. Dre, what do I do? Every time I see you after we've been separated, what do I do? We have sex? No, no, no. Not just sex. After every time we have been separated, the moment I see you, the second you walk through the door, I suck your dick! Every time! Do you think I wanted to do that? Dre? I didn't know you were keeping a blowjob tab. That's not what I'm saying. What I am saying, dre, is that I sucked your dick for us! I sucked it for us because I knew, sooner or later, I was gonna need you to do something for me that you didn't want to do. You owe me. Do you hear yourself? You're addicted to this shit. See, what you're not understanding, this is all I have. Okay? I don't have a talent. Right? (Stammering) I don't sing. I don't dance. I don't act. I don't tell jokes. I'm not you, dre. You have to... You have to choose me. Benny: Erica? Okay? Everyone needs to see you choose me. Erica. I am finally famous. Don't ruin this for me! Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Don't say nothin'. Oh, look at you. You look great. These streets are dangerous. I said it. This reminds me of eighth grade. We got locked up for playing hooky. Remember that? Andre: Don't say "we." The cops grabbed me. You let 'em catch you. (Silk chuckles) What was I supposed to do, let you get locked up by yourself? Dre, next time they give you one call, Benny:  Here's what you are going to do. You are going to attend your bachelor party. And then you're going to climb up on that jet and you, my man, are going to get married. And then, and only then, I will make sure that your little incident plays into the press like it was part of the show. I will tell the media, the cops, your parole officer, that we all thought the alcohol was fake. Everybody knows that these shows aren't real. But if you decide to do something drastic, you are on your own. Your own. It's okay. (Sighs) (Indistinct video game noises) Chelsea: Hey, young lady, it is way past your bedtime. Come on, two more minutes? I got some more pigs to kill. Turn off grandma's phone. It's not grandma's. It's mine. Yours. Who gave you a phone? The prince sent it. I got strict orders to have you out of here in 45 minutes. Sorry about the movie. There's always word of mouth. It could still be a hit! If you say so. (Rap music playing) (People cheering) Andre: You guys ever been here? I have not been here. No. My wife gave me 20 minutes and said, "get in, get out." We're not here now. (All laughing) Watch your pockets, too, they will pick it. That's a guarantee. Not being racist. That's being ho-ist. Who? Some of these chicks need money and you fuckin' know it. Relax. You been here before, whoopi? Mmm-mmm. Woman: Hey, whoopi. Hi, Jasmine. Woman: Hi, Jerry. My niece. She goes to my temple. Whatever you do, don't get a mistress. Can't do it. You'll get caught. Just be a good person. You can handle that. Just be good. Stay good to her. Stay true to her. Whack off. Whack off. Whack off. Whack off. And if it does happen, do not confess. You will get caught. Just because... No matter what, even if she finds an actual vagina in your pocket. Sandler: Don't confess. "I don't know how it got there." My wife found two pussies in my glove compartment. And I had to convince her, you know, it's a standard option on a Mercedes. (Laughing) You can lie as much as you want, she's going to know. It takes a village. Don't cheat. I have no plans to cheat. I know, no one does. No one plans to speed. Biggie, Jay, nas, ghostface, jadakiss. If you gonna say gang starr, then you need to say c.L. Smooth, Pete rock. You the one that picked the scenario over... What's the other one? Silk:  The symphony. Fred:  The symphony. Fucking  scenario is better than  symphony, nigga! Can I finish? (Hip-hop music playing) (Inaudible) Goldberg:  So how you doing? I'm all right. I mean, all that stuff that's on TV, that was... That was just for the show. I'm not really drinking. Okay, I got married a lot of times. You've been at several of my weddings. But I always knew that wasn't what I was into. I wasn't into the wedding and everyone knew it. I should have been into the guy. As you should be into the girl. Make her sign the prenup. Prenup. It's a hard conversation, but just do it. You will be happy in the long run. My money. Whose money is it? Who wrote the jokes? I wrote the jokes. Keep that fucking cash. Sign that shit. Did you get one? I did not. Fuck! (Music playing) (Crowd cheering) (Whooping) Gonna go outside and check on the car. Got a plane to catch. All right, hurry up. We gotta get out of here. I'm on it! You know I'm on it. Hey, Andre, she really loved the phone. James nielson! Can I talk to you for a second? I don't want to talk to you, James. Please? No! I don't want to talk. Hey, everybody! This man right here is a journalist! He is not to be trusted! Okay. I'm sorry. Okay, James is a character I created a very long time ago, and unfortunately, he's still a very popular character. Character? What are you, Sasha fierce? Oh, I got it. Shakira Simmons. Shakara. Shakara Simmons. Yeah. Who gives a fuck? Was it all a lie? Of course not. Were you in character the whole time? No! Any of it? Your mother, your kid. Your cinderella bullshit. I'm really sorry. What I did was wrong and it was creepy and it was weird. And I know you won't believe me, but I actually did it because I like you. All right? The fan in me just wanted to know what happened to that guy that I saw at purchase. You liked me? Yes, that made me laugh and cry. Bouncer: You can't touch the girls. I don't know where it is, but she has it. I don't have any clothes on. Where am I gonna put it? Do I have to say it? We got drama. Come on. We gotta go. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hey, Andre? Are you going my way? So are you okay, alky? (Stammering) Yeah, I'm real good. It's not as bad as it looks. I got a Google alert that said that the incident was part of the show. But I could tell that you were really drinking. You're not that good of an actor. Mmm, nice one, James. Hey, where are we going? I thought we were just dropping her off. We're just making a little stop first. Stop where? Man 1: Yo, come on. (Man 2 laughing) Thank you. I thought we'd just see a couple, and then, you know, we can just get out of here. (Horn honks) Man 1: Yo, hammy! Man 2: Wassup, hammy! What's happenin', man? You going on? No, no. All right. Host:  Look around the room, look around the room, look around the room, any guy not laughing at that right now, is on a date. (Audience laughing) There is a battle going on at the table between the man and the woman. What's up, man? The man wants leverage. How's it going? The woman wants leverage. See, when the check comes, that's called the "no pussy deposit." (Audience laughing) on not having to do shit with you later on that night. You ever see how the girl, when she drops the twenty, she holds her hand up like she shot a three-pointer, then gets back on defense? Bam! Female comedian:  Oh, my gosh, look at this outfit. This is what you look like when you start giving up. Take a note. People keep asking me if I'm from Michigan. I'm like, "no, I'm done. "It looks the same." (Audience laughing) It looks exactly the fucking same. I don't wear anything that doesn't transition well to bed from now on. If I can't pull the bra out the sleeve, I'm not interested in you. I'm not interested. Yeah, how come every movie with slaves always has that one scene? (Vocalizing) It's like... It's like slave idol. (Humming tune) You guys ain't going to believe this. The one, the only, Andre Allen! (Audience cheering) Whoo! Whoo! Oh, wow. Um... What can I say? Um... Please lower your expectations. (Audience laughing) It's not gonna be that good. What the hell am I doing up here? I haven't done this in a long time. It's like, "I hate dating. I hate dating." I like dates. Dates are cool. 'Cause a date means someone is considering fucking you. (Audience laughing) They have to, like, ponder it. It's just... Anybody you can eat with, you might have a chance of fucking. So, and they're just pondering fucking you. They're weighing it in their head. They're going, "ah..." "ah, his dick, my mouth. I wonder." And even if it doesn't happen, you just feel... I feel good. I mean, any day somebody thinks about fucking you is a good day. That's the thing with women. Like... They don't... no matter what you do for a woman, if it doesn't end in marriage, this was a waste of time. I don't care what you do for her. You could... got her a job, you know, cured her diabetes, taught her how to read. But if it's over and you don't marry her, it's like, "I can't believe I wasted my time with you." "Fuck you and your letters." "I could have been married with diabetes by now." What can I say? Um... All I can say is, don't make any major decisions after a blowjob. (Audience laughing) You know, let the blowjob wear off. Then you figure out what you want to do, you know. That's just my advice to you. I'm sure that's what happened to j.F.K, you know. Marilyn Monroe gave him a blowjob and, you know, he was, like, "I'm gonna get me a convertible." (Audience laughing) Whoo! Host:  One more time! Andre Allen! Whoa! Come on. Hurry up! That was incredible! Man: Hammy! You still got it! I told you! Yes. Amazing. Oh, my God. Get in there, get in there. Man 1: Hammy, keep it real. Man 2: Yo, hammy. Come on, go, go, go, go! (Tires screech) Wow. That was incredible! Amazing. As always. Chelsea: Wasn't he amazing? You were amazing. You were so great. Wow! Ooh! Whoo! (Chuckles) How do you feel? I feel... Insane, man! I feel like, uh, you know, it's like, uh, like, uh, I took the pill and I'm in the matrix. Um... Like, I can't believe it. I'm just watching the people. And I can hear them laugh, and I could feel the laughter. Okay, what got you up there? What did it? When I met you this morning, you mentioned this show that I did at your school like 15 years ago. And I remembered it. It was a good show. It was. You just got me thinking about being on stage. So, that's all it took, huh? That... Mmm-hmm. ...and jail. Jail. You were barely in there. Andre:  After I got off the phone with Erica, I thought I was at bottom. I was like, "this is it, I have fucked up everything." And at that moment, I heard this crazy sound. (Growling) Mmm? Andre: Wow. Dmx. What are you doing here? Really? What am I doing here? I'm x, man. I live in this motherfucker, man. Don't you watch the news? Damn, homie. I respect the fuck out of your shit, man. Uprize? I'm gonna see that as soon as I get out, man. Yo, man, thanks a lot, man. I'm a big fan of yours, too. One thing I really respect about you, why I fuck with you for real, son, is that you won't let the industry box you in. We're pretty much on some same shit, yo. I'm kind of tired of rapping, man. Plus, I got so much more to offer. That's what I always say, man. I got so much more to offer. You got a minute? Yeah. Check this out. ¶ Smile, though your heart is aching ¶ smile, even though it's breaking ¶ when there are clouds in the sky ¶ you'll get by ¶ smile through the pain and sorrow ¶ what? ¶ Smile and maybe tomorrow ¶ you'll see the sun come shining through ¶ for you prisoner: Shut the fuck up! ¶ Light up your face with gladness (All booing) ¶ Hide every trace of sadness ¶ and although a tear is ever so near ¶ that's the time you must keep on trying ¶ smile, what's the use of crying?

Got my cell phone. Everything. That's good. Have a safe flight. Thanks. Listen, I'm going to be in L.A. in October. This gallery wants to showcase my photos. Send you an invite. You can bring your wife. You know I can't go, right? It's very nice to meet you, Andre Allen. It's great to finally meet you, Chelsea brown. Fry or die. Yo, chels! What's your top five? (Sobs) (Sniffs) Salt-n-pepa, tribe called quest, the roots, public enemy, kanye. And I get six, man. Slick Rick the ruler! Slick Rick. Take care. You, too. (Engine starts) She's a little skinny for my taste. But if it was me, I would be up there right now. I wouldn't worry about Erica. One way or another, she's going to end up on top. Can't have 'em all, man. I'm not talking about having 'em all. I'm talking about having her. What you got in that gift bag, man? Let me check. Uh... Got some vodka. Okay. Mmm. In my gift bag. Somebody wasn't thinking about me. (Laughing) I'll take that off your hands. What else you got, man? Got a Jasmine-scented candle. Definitely something I would give a man. I got a Mexican  chica. She loves candles. She's a candle bitch. What else you got? Uh... Gourmet nuts. You know I love some nuts. That's for me. Give me those. Andre: There you go. Hopefully honey-roasted. When they put the honey on the nuts? Mmm-hmm. That's a whole different world right there. (Continues talking) And let's see. A gift certificate for... Silk: That's when they took it to a new level. You know me, I'm a snacker. Now, if they could find a way to put the honey inside the, uh... Some kind of cloning shit, I don't know. Is that cloning? Mmm-hmm. (Hip-hop music playing) Yo, silk. You want the top five? All: Yes! Man: Yes. Here it is. Sugarhill gang, eminem... Right. Wale, ice cube... Man: Whoa! ...and sir mix-a-lot! (All clamoring) Yes! "Put 'em on the glass"! (Hip-hop music playing)
