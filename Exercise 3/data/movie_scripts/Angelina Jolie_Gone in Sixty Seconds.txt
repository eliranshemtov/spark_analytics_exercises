Corner of Wiltern and Wetherly. Tumbler messed up. Said the Porsche would be at the corner of Wiltern and Wetherly. - Right there. - You're bullshittin' me, right? - 9024 Wiltern? - What? That? I gotta get my tool. - Kip! - He ain't bullshittin'. Kip! Man, that's not a tool. That's a damn brick. Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man, we might as well call prison and make reservations. Aw, come on. - Oh... - Get the number. 42850. Hurry up, man. Man, let's go! Let's get the hell outta here. OK, Billy Badass. You got us in here, now tell me how the hell we gonna get out. Oh, no, I know you ain't gonna do what I think you're gonna do. Oh, man! Come on! - This ain't The Dukes of Hazzard. - Come on! Aaaaaagh! Yo, so check out my new move. I call it "the stranger." What I do is, I sit on my hand for, like, 15, 20 minutes, until it goes numb. No feeling at all. And then... I rub one out. "The stranger," huh? It's like a little boy's nursery school I've come upon here. Where are they? Hey! - Leave those people alone, man. - Oh, my God. Sweetie, you're so talented. - Stolen car. Stolen car. - I know. I know. Hey, I love ya. Man, we going to jail, man! Come on! ...hands behind your back. You have the right to remain silent. Hey, watch it! We have a silver Porsche, estimated speed 80 miles per hour, - heading west on Wilshire Boulevard. - Yeah. This is Air One. We have a visual of the suspect, southbound on Vincent Thomas Bridge. - Something wrong, Tumbler? - Yeah, I'm missing Jerry Springer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! That's right, that's right, that's right! - Ha-ha! What's up, old man? - She'll go zero to 60 in 5.2 seconds. Believe me, I can vouch for that. Ground units, be advised, suspects last seen entering south side of warehouse. 13 down, 37 to go. - What the hell is that? - What is that, man? Now you've gone and done it, Raines. Tumbler! Get the board and get the lights! - I got it! - This is bullshit! - It's not comin' off! - Keys! Get the keys! - I got 'em, I got 'em! - Come on, everybody, let's go! Hurry up! - I got it! - Let's go! Toby. get it! Let's go, boys! Come on, come on, come on! I got the light! I got the light! Go, 90. go! Let's go! Shit! VIN number on that? Got it. What do we got? All gone. We didn't get a single one of 'em, and we are talkin' about professionals. No visible damage to locking mechanisms, steering columns or ignitions, and, as you can see, these are not Honda Civics. This is one of three brand-new Mercedes - a car they say is unstealable. Yeah, unless you get the laser-cut transponder key sent directly to the US dealer from Hamburg. They got somebody working on the inside. Let's find out which dealership sold 'em, serviced 'em, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, I'll get on it. - Mr. Drycoff? - Yeah? Let's impound these cars for one month. I don't give a damn if they belong to Torn Cruise. Control. Vision. Determination. These are the three fundamental components of the new-generation race-car driver. Speed is a by-product. Goin' fast. But remember - the car is you. You are the car. OK? Let's ride! Billy, you just shaved one second off your lap time! Tommy, I don't know what that was, but it wasn't driving. Go get 'em! Well, well, well. What do you pay your pit crews with? Oreos and Gummi Bears? I folded, Atley. You know that. What are you doing here? - Is there some place we can talk? - About what? About your brother and the deep shit he's in. Frank. Would you watch the kids for a minute? - Tell me about Kip. - He took a job and he fumbled it. Now he's jammed up. He's jammed up bad. - What kind of job? - A boost. A big boost. A boost. What's Kip doin' on a boost? Oh, you're shittin' me, man. Kip's become quite the little crew runner since you left. - You don't talk to your ma? - She neglected to mention it. Listen, I need somethin'. I need something cold to drink. I thought we were goin' someplace to talk. - Who was the job for? - A new guy named Raymond Calitri. They call him the Carpenter. He's runnin' all the dark ponies down there now. He's a full-on devil-came-down- to-Long-Beach trip. He's bad. He's real bad. And this Calitri is the one who's after my brother? Like stains on a mattress. And you should know I work for him. There weren't a lot of opportunities for retired car thieves on the gimp. He put me to work. But I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy, he scares the shit out of even me. What are you doing, man? Stop! Stop! Atley Jackson. Right. - They have Kip. - Take me there. Raymond Calitri, Memphis Raines. I try to learn your ways, understand your obsessions. But this baseball, it's so bleedin' boring. Isn't? Where's my brother? Memphis Raines. Your legend precedes you. Atley tells me you're the best. After you left, auto theft in the South Bay area went down 47%. Where's my brother? I'm proud of these. Straddle chair from the Arts and Crafts period. Mahogany table with cloud-lift pattern, black walnut wine table. Metal's cold, ugly. Wood's warm, clean. Provided by nature. To see a piece of furniture take shape, it's like watching a child grow. I asked you a question. They threw us out England, threw us out of France, but here we are. Flourishing, really, except for the minor inconvenience of despising everything about your country. On this list, you'll find 50 cars. Five-zero. I need all 50 delivered to Long Beach Harbor, pier 14, by 8am four days from now. I'm paying $200,000. I'm not interested. I'm just here for my brother. Your Kip came to me. He had street cred. The brother of the notorious Memphis Raines. So two weeks ago I hired him and advanced him $10,000. Atley told me. If it's about the advance, I can understand your anger. A debt has to be settled. Ten grand, from me to you. - I wish it was that easy. - I don't see the complication. I have four days to deliver 50 cars, and I have no cars. - Well, that's another problem. - It is another problem, isn't it? It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars because I said I would, because if I don't, my South American friend goes somewhere else from now on. And that's not good. It's a humiliation. Because I'm the arsehole who said I could deliver. Am I an arsehole? Do I look like an arsehole? Yeah. - I need that paper satisfying. - I'm retired. Now, where the hell is my brother? I made this as well. My first one. It takes 80,000 pounds of pressure to crush a car. Kip? - Who's that? - Memphis. - Oh, shit. - You OK? - Shut it off! - Turn it off! You've got 30 seconds to consider your options. Shut it off! One. You kill me, they kill you, your brother dies anyway. Two. You lie, you accept the job, you take your brother, you run. I hunt you down, I kill you, I kill your brother and I kill your mother for the aggravation you've caused me. Three. You accept the deal, you steal some cars, you make some money and you be a big brother. - Memphis! - 8am, Friday morning. The cars are on the boat, or your brother's in the coffin. Get me out of here! Somebody get me out of here! Listen, you really don't have to make me anything. Oh, hey, you come down here, you save my ass. It's the least I can do. Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas some place up north, or something, right? - Yeah, working with kids. - Oh, yeah. First place. I remember this. Oh, yeah. That was a... that was a long time ago. - What did you put in it? - I don't know. It's good. - Does Mom know about any of this? - No, she doesn't, and... I don't think she should. You know, she works really hard, and... She doesn't need to know about any of this stuff. Look, you know, I got everything under control. Kitchen's on fire. Uh... Man! Hey, Memphis. It's good to see you. Haul the cartons over there! - Hey, Fuzzy. - Aw, shit. What are you doing here? - I told you I don't know anything. - Yeah, but you're a liar. - You're gonna get me fired, man. - Fired? That's not good. - You're on parole, right? - Fuzzy. Hey. Nobody wants to get you fired. We just need this information, is all. Two weeks ago, a call came in for a lot of top-end cars. - And who made that call? - I don't have a clue. - OK, we should go talk to your boss. - Shh! The delivery date. I know the delivery date. - And when is that? - Thursday, Friday, end of the week. Well, you get me a name within 48 hours, or we'll be back. - Good to see you, buddy. - Thank you. - I'm looking for Helen Raines. - Helen, some guy is here for you. What guy? What's he look like? Like a firecracker. Like your son. - You look so good. - Thank you, Mom. - I got a spring bouquet. - What are you doing here? Well, Atley Jackson came to see me. He told me something about Kip. Can I help you with one of these? Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe who just walked into the Quality Cafe. I can't say I'm surprised. All his life he looked up to you, tried to be you. Guess now he is. So why is this happening? I send you guys money. He met some people, and he changed. He lost that... that sweetness. You know? OK. Tell me. How deep in is he? Deep. Can you get him out? It means doing things. Things I told you I'd never do again. Do what it takes, Randall. - When did you get into town, Raines? - Last night. - Last night? What for? - I thought I'd catch a Lakers game. Heard we got Shaquille. You guys wanna go? - Guess not. - Randall, Randall, Randall. Come here. I get this call from this uniform, you know. Axton. Very nice man. Remembers everything. This man calls me up, says, "Guess who's back in town." I say, "Who?" He says, "Randall Raines." I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?" He says, "Yeah." I say, "impossible." He says, "No, he's back." I say, "No, he's not." He says, "Yes, I will bet you $200 I just saw Randall Raines." - You guys said a lot. Look, Detective... - No, whoa, whoa. What's really, really ironic about this - two nights ago, we snare these 13 fresh stolens waiting for export, right? And at the time I'm thinking, "This feels like Randall Raines." Now, it didn't have your panache, your ï¬‚ash, but it just felt like Randall Raines. And now here you are. Look, I don't know what you boys are looking for, but I just got back. OK? It was a family emergency. Now, that's the truth. "Family emergency." Yeah, I got a family emergency, too, Randall. I gotta go tell my woman that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal. - Mm, she's mean. - What? She can be mean. It's not so... Come here. Come here, Randall. And take those glasses off, Randall, please. Do me a favor. Six years ago you make a real smart move, you know. You retire from a life that's gonna get you busted or killed, or maybe even both. And I'm thinkin' that not putting you away when I had a chance is like this big bug up the ass of this real impressive career that I've had. Oh, yeah, well, without disappointment, you can't appreciate victory. - Eleanor tell you that? - Well, now, that's hittin' below the belt. Yeah, all right, let me tell you about "below the belt," Randall. I tell you what - from here on out, if you walk across the street outside of a crosswalk, if you roll through a stop sign, if you use an aerosol can in a manner other than directed... I mean, I don't care. You make one slip, and I will put you away for good. - OK. - By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in, you know, little spaceships. That's gonna suck. Who's Eleanor? It's a damn car. And don't ever talk about my wife. Excuse me. Do you know where Otto is? He's in the back, in the paint shop. Is that you? It's about time you came to see me. - I missed you. - Good to see you! - You look great. - It's good to see you. - You remember my Junie? - Hey, Junie. How are you? - We're doing good, thank you. - Good. Good. - You look happy. - Well, I am happy. I really am. - So what happened here? - What do you mean? Well, it's nice. But the chop shop, the stripped cars, my education... What happened? Hey. Old age happened. That's what happened. Got tired of killin' 'em. You know, I woke up one morning and thought: "I'm no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection." Now we restore, we revive. Come here. Remember when we used to do this? - What? - You know. Come here. OK. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. Le Mans 1971. - Quad cam. - That's a V-12. V-12! Right, right, right, right! Here it peaks... at 5500 RPM! What do you know about Raymond Calitri? - Who? - Raymond Calitri. Uh, excuse us, sweetness. I'll be right back. - We can talk right here. - No, no, no, no. It's all right. Raymond Calitri. He's a jackal tearing at the soft belly of our... of our fair town. And he's an asshole to boot, so be careful. I heard about Kip. - Are you considering a comeback tour? - Do you think it can be done? Don't do this to me, OK? Please. Please. Not now. Oh, man. - How many cars? - 50. - How many days? - Three. How many in your crew? One, but I came here hoping to negotiate for a second. No way. It can't be done. I mean, you need time to prep, time to shop. You know that. It has to be. They're gonna kill him. Man. It was a mistake to come here. You have a great life now. I don't wanna upset that. Uh, wait a minute. Whoa. Hold on. Look around you. These days I'm all about second chances. So let's make a few phone calls and we'll go from there, OK? OK. Don't look at me. Look at the people next to you! Turn the wheel! Pull over! Pull it the hell over! - Asshole! - Learn how to drive! Don't touch nothin'. Just... No! You can't negotiate turns, you can't signal properly, you can't maintain speed, you can't parallel park. Hell, you can't drive, honey. Shit, I can't swim. I know I can't. So you know what I do? I stay my black ass out the pool! All right, now, just... Just... Can you... Hello? Memphis! Hey, how are you? Sure, sure. When? OK. All right, man. Thanks a lot. Donny. Just take it around the block a couple of times, OK? All right. Hello, I'm calling for Frankie Fish. Frank's dead, man. Yeah, he got scragged. I'm sorry. Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Henry Santoro. He went down to Florida with that asshole Frankie Fish. You see him, you tell him I want my money. I didn't mess with your money. Yes, ma'am. I'm looking for Dan and Mikey. Both of 'em up to Chino, doin' a nickel apiece. No, I'm not so sure I wanna tell you who this is. Yeah, try it, asshole. You sound, uh, very busy right now. You sound very, very busy. Whoo. - There's only two names left. - Yeah? I wanna see who you got. Sphinx... Those two? No way. - There's no one else. - Are you sure? - You tell him. - Listen, why should I be... You were the one who answered the phone, right? Fine! But how's a guy who can't speak gonna take a phone call? You've got a call! Sphinx, is that you? Press a button if it's you. - Sway, you set up this brake job? - Yeah. He warped all four rotors. He must've been riding those brakes like an old lady. - That's nice. - Sounds like the left bank's running lean. The service department's over there. - Can I talk to you? - Talk to me? Yeah, sure. Talk. - Well, thing of it is, I came back because... - Do you know what time it is? It's 5:30. I came back because... - I gotta go. I'm late for work. - Here. - You're at work. - I got two jobs. I have discovered that you have to work twice as hard when it's honest. - Hey, Sway, can I get another shot? - Yeah. - You're still looking amazing. - While you look like a bible salesman. You're healed. - Can we improvise a little bit? - Sure. What do you have in mind? Do you wanna get a little crazy? There's a Cutlass 4-4-2 in the back. We can strip down and shine the hood. What do you say? - Uh, that's not what I had in mind. - No? It's about my brother. - Kip's in trouble. - In trouble? - He took a boost, and he blew it. - Shit. - And you got some Italians? - Five or six. - Right. - It's 50 ladies in 24 hours, $200,000. Well, I've cleaned up. I understand. I hate to even come here and ask you... - Sway, can I get that drink now, please? - Yes. And I had to ask a few of the others, too, and I feel bad about it, but... But you had no choice. You had to come here. Yeah. Pretty much. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. I'd love to help Kip, but I'm not into the life anymore. - Well, that's a good thing. - Yeah. - I'm glad to see you're doing well. - Sorry I can't help you. - I'd like to pay for your drink. - That's fine. How about that drink? Yeah, how about that drink? Raines! Memphis Raines, huh? - Do I know you? - Well, you should know me, considering all the business you done screwed up for me in the past, baby. - Johnny B. - That's me. What can I do for you? Well, I'm gonna tell you what you can do for me, baby. Get out of Long Beach tonight. I'll be gone in three days. I'm just here on some family business. Word on the street says Raymond Calitri hired you and your brother for a top order. - A order should've went to me. - That's not the way it went down, Johnny. Hey! Get away from my car, asshole! You got somethin' to say before I kill you, fool? Sphinx. Otto send you? Oh, Dad. Probably both be working at the dealership if he hadn't died. Just like normal people. Shit. What's the matter with you? Man, six years does a lot of different things to people. You know, I don't know where you went, but, you know, you're in there, you're talkin' about bein' normal. I mean, you were always the one who was goin' after the easy money. I didn't do it for the money. I did it for the cars. Gleaming in marina blue... sunflower yellow... Marlboro red. Begging to be plucked. And I'd do it. I'd boost her... and just blast to Palm Springs, instantly feeling better about being me. And then, the next day, it seems like, I'm getting shot at, my friends are dying, people are going to jail. I didn't like what I'd become. Yeah, and then you left, and then I didn't have a brother anymore. And now you wanna give me advice, and I don't even know you. And, you know, I got my own family now. I got my own friends. And, you know, you can say what you want about them, but they're loyal. Well, when you hit the wall, the same thing is gonna happen. You and your family are either gonna get shot or get a five-year jolt at Corcoran. Those Mercedes we impounded, need those newfangled laser-cut keys? Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors, downtown Newport, where all the employees are clean except for him. James Lakewood, served a nickel at Folsom for auto insurance fraud. Well, gosh, I bet he just neglected to mention that to the people at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh? It gets better. Young James there places orders for lost keys to Mercedes home office in Germany. The list. Ah, the list. I guess we gotta start beatin' the bushes and try to find out where they... Whoa. - 1967 Shelby GT 500. - I know. I know. You got Eleanor here? Otto, there's somebody here to see you. Oh! The puppy's a big dog now. - How you doin'? - Hey, there, Kip. What is this up... What's that up under there? Hey, Otto. How you doin'? It's a long time. Good to see you. What are you doin' here, Kip? Well, actually... We came to talk about some things. - About what? - Well, you know. It seems like you guys need a little help, and we thought that we should participate. But I just promised Morn I was getting you out of this. Listen... No, no, we're talking about a lot of money here. - And if you guys think you're gonna be... - What? Money? ...gettin' into our Kool-Aid... Is that why you think I'm doing this? You inconsiderate little punk! - If you wanna participate, tell Morn... - You think three washed-up car thieves... ...why her little pumpkin's gonna get hurt! - ...are gonna steal 50 cars in two days? Hey. Hey.- This is why I do not do business with family. I think you should consider this. Oh, come on, now, Otto, please. No, his criminal career has come to an end. Well, his life will come to an end unless we pull this off. And how can we do it without him? It can't be done, and you know it. - You guys have any skills at all? - Please. Yeah, we have skills. Urn, Mirror Man here, he's an electronics expert. You know, he's got some gadgets that you old farts probably never heard of. You know, uh, Tumbler over here, he can pretty much drive anything with wheels, and, you know, some things without wheels. And, uh, Toby, he's a computer genius. He does fascinating things with computers. What exactly can you do with a computer, Toby? I can hack into the DMV mainframe, I can change VIN numbers, I can change addresses, registrations. I can do a lot of really tricky stuff, OK? All right, all right, we do this, we do it my way. I run this show. You take your orders from me. If you have any problems with that, you can leave now. No, that's fine. Who is Gilligan here, and what does he do? Gilligan is actually Freb. Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business. - What? - It's true. Hey, People gotta eat, right? This is outrageous. I want my lawyer. - I'm not saying a word till I get a lawyer. - All right, James, that's an option. - And, frankly, a reasonable one. - So you call your lawyer, James. You tell him you've been arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto. - We indict you. - He'll bail you out. - And we move on to trial. - OK, OK. Kid came to me, said he'd pay $500 a key. So I put the order forms through, and he picked 'em up a couple days later. - What's the kid's name? - We kept it anonymous. He was a well-built kid. Uh, looks like a boxer. - What do you want me to do? - When he comes back, you call us. - What says he comes back? - A hunch. To make the Friday 8am deadline, you're gonna have to go old-school. A one-night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. OK? - One night? - Yes. What, are you crazy? One night? What, do you have, like, a better plan or something? Yeah, you spread it out. You play shadow games and shit. We're on a truncated timetable. Otto, I'm sorry. Can you just listen to me for one second? We heard you, Kip. Shadow games. But what you have to understand is that if you play shadow games, by the second night, the heat is onto you. With a one-night boost, by the time the first car is reported stolen, your ship's set sail. It's a surprise attack. This is a complicated list, fellas. it really is. OK? There are 25 that aren't a problem, but these exotics are tough to find. And the new Mercedes, they require laser-cut keys. OK? - Yeah, I got that covered. - You have that covered? What'd I just say? Yeah, I got it covered. All right, all right. Well, then, let's get to work. Toby, hack into the insurance database and find as many cars as you can. Yes! I got addresses on Hilary, Natalie and Tracy. Donny, check the DMV for the remaining cars on the list. I'm sorry, miss, but you've missed five questions. That's failing. No! No! Why? You're supposed to go faster when somebody tailgates you! Ah. Hello again. Here's your list of the 20 car owners' names and addresses that you requested. - Thank you. - That's $100, please. $100? Well, $5 a car, 20 cars. Would you like a calculator? It used to be $2 a car. Thanks a lot. My name's Roger, sir. May I be of some help? - That's funny. My name's Roger. - Two Rogers don't make a right. - Roger, I have a problem. - Yes? I've been in LA three months now. I have money, I have taste. But I'm not on anybody's A list, and Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week for me. Well, a Ferrari would certainly change that. Perhaps. But, you know... This is the one. Yes, yes, yes. I saw three of these parked outside the local Starbucks this morning, which tells me only one thing - there's too many self-indulgent wieners in this city with too much bloody money! Now, if I was driving a 1967 275 GTB four-cam... You would not be a self-indulgent wiener, sir. - You'd be a connoisseur. - Precisely. Champagne would fall from the heavens. Doors would open. Velvet ropes would part. I don't have one here. However, I do have one in the warehouse. Superb. What else do you have in the warehouse? Mm. All right. Uh-huh. That was Mr. Lakewood from the dealership. He says that boxer-looking punk is gonna pick up the keys to three new Mercedes today. Same make and model as the ones we already got impounded. Now we talkin'. The El Spirito de Graciela sails Friday, 8am sharp. We'll target all the cars within 45 minutes of here. By the time their alarm-tracking systems are activated, the cars will already be in these containers. Fellas, this is Sway. No questions. I'm here for Kip. - All right. - All right. It's me. He's here. - In the red Chevy Nova? - Uh, that's affirmative, sir. What's goin' on, bro? All right, as soon as he leaves, you call me with the owners' addresses. - All right? - I'll get those forms right over, sir. Damn boss. Always on my case. - I got three here? - Mm-hm. Thank you. Huh. Randall Raines, Donny Astricky. Otto Halliwell. - Should I set up some tails? - Uh-uh. They're too smart for that. They'll just dump the cars. No, we'll get them with the Mercedes. Let's set up, uh, three surveillance teams at those addresses. Now, you go ahead and you make your move, man... and I will be waiting for you. Why do you call 'em girls' names? That's a good question. Why do you call 'em girls' names? It's code. You say Jane, you say Shirley, Lucy, Edna, and nobody listening on the waves is the wiser. Got 'em. All right, we've got the addresses on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em. - There she is. - Nice. Damn, it's cold up here. They keep these Ferraris refrigerated? Man, you know black people don't like cold weather. We're a tropical people, man. When this is over, I'm gonna smoke a joint, watch two hours of Roots, and I'm gonna kick your ass. Hello, and welcome to "TV Car Trivia." First question - who was the driver of a '73 Firebird? - Uh, Otto. - Jim Rockford, Rockford Files. Give me Columbo. - A Peugeot convertible. - What color? Gray. - How you know that? - 'Cause I love that show. Well, I got three words for all y'all - get a life. Oh, this is some kiddie shit, Sphinx. - What's on Magnum PI's license plate? - Robin1. Wait, wasn't Robin that fagoty guy who hung with him? No, that was Higgins. That was Higgins. Hey, ten points for our fearless leader. Sway, how about giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta? He drove a Corvette in "The Magician," a Ford pickup truck in "The Incredible Hulk," and in "The Courtship of Eddie's Father," he walked. - Bingo. - My man. Al, tell me somethin'. Nothin' doin' here, sir. Nobody's showing. COPY- A minivan approaching. And it seems a little late for soccer practice. Heads up. I think we got some activity right here. Oh, that is... Looks like it's Kip Raines. And we got a Randall Raines. If they take this, we will take them down. He's pulling something out of his pocket. You see that? It's a camera. Looks like he's just doing some homework. All right, let's leave him be. I don't wanna burn this. They will be back. Huh. You know what? Let's go over to Otto's in the morning. Kick over some rocks, see what's underneath there. We saved the best for last - the '67 Shelby Mustang GT 500. - The GT 500? - Yeah, yeah. There she is. Yep. There's Eleanor. - Eleanor is Memphis's unicorn. - What's a unicorn? A fabled creature? You know, the horse with the horn? Impossible to capture? The one car no matter how many times you try to boost, something always happens. We're gonna get through this this time, right? It's gonna be smooth. - What's he doing? - It's gonna be easy. He's talking to her, man. Trying to get reacquainted. You know, they had a rough history. She almost got him killed a couple of times. - He flipped one on the Harbor Freeway. - He went off the Long Beach Pier once. A smooth, easy ride. We're just gonna glide. Big night tomorrow, guys. Let's go home. - Did you get the picture? - Yeah. See you tomorrow night, Eleanor, with your fine ass. Yeah, we're almost home. You wanna get something to eat? I'd like to get a chocolate malt. - Hey, man! - Get out of the car! Go, go, go, go, go, go! - Why are people shooting at us? - 'Cause I blew up their car. Over here! "Beast"? OK, OK. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Aah! on! Oh, you think it's a game? Johnny B! Cops, man. I ain't got nothin' but time, baby. Oh, man, we're gonna be here all night, man. Look! Cop car! Uh-huh! Long as I'm in here, you're just gonna sit out there. Aren't ya? A'ight? Hey, listen, this is the plan. This is what we're gonna do. There's a big rig over there. Uh, mister, is that your truck out there, the Big Rig Wrecker? - The Big Rig Wrecker's mine... - That's cool. What do I gotta do? How do I learn? What do I do? Where do I go? - Well, you gotta go to truck-driving school. - Truck dri... I know, man, I know. But I mean, like, um... You boys ready to play a little pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey? Can I get you a jelly doughnut or something, man? - No, I'm just gonna go ahead and go. - 'Cause I'm gonna have the waffle... Maybe next time, though. I'm gonna smoke you! Damn! What the hell's going on? Want some of this? Yeah. - You guys got permits for these weapons? - Oh, man. So you think I can only get pizzas, huh? - Boosted it myself. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. How'd you get it? Actually, the keys were in it. Well, that kind of defies the point then, don't it? You stole a car that wasn't on the list. You stole a car that wasn't on the list! Why didn't you just go to the police station in a red clown suit and let everybody know what we're doin' here? - What have we got? - I don't know. - Shit! Fellas. - What? - Give me that. Let me see that. - Check this out. Check this out! - What? - Look. - This looks like heroin. - What? Where did you get this car? In front of some poker parlor in Chinatown. Ever consider why a car in a neighborhood like that would have its keys left in it? Maybe because nobody in that neighborhood would be stupid enough to try to rip this car off. - Get this shit out of here. Take it back. - No, no, no, we can't take it back. - Get it out of here! - Will everybody relax for a second? Shut up! Take it back! I'm comin' after this shit. Give me that. Give me that. Now!

Here's Donny. - How you been, D? - I'm just happy to see you, brother. Yeah. I got to tell you, Randall, seeing you here, Otto, Donny... makes me feel almost nostalgic. Kind of like a big reunion. You should stick around, 'cause later we're gonna make s'mores and sing "Kumbaya." - What is this? - What, this? - This. - They call this a Cadillac. - What's wrong with it, Otto? - Needs restoration. - What? - Brightening. - Otto. You got a '39 Ford right there. - Well, that's a pretty car, isn't it? - Isn't that a nice car? - Right here you got a '53 Fiat Vignale. Now these are beautiful cars, Otto. And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado? Yeah. I mean, who the hell pays to brighten up a Cadillac Eldorado? I think it holds a certain... sentimental value, you know? N-nothing more.

DMV not on file. - Copy that. Thank you. - See, I know what you're doing. I know. You're thinking there's no want, but that I stripped its guts and crated her up, right? - Is that what you did, Randall? - No, I didn't do it. You know, forget it. You're trying to hurt my feelings? Fine! You know what? Go ahead. Do it. Let her rip. - Go ahead. Rev it up. - All right, goddammit, I will. Sell it to you cheap. Yeah, '83, first year they put the auto-ride control on these boys. Oh, I don't know. You probably know more about cars at this point than I do. Ha! What, you slippin' on me, Randall? No, it's just your knowledge overwhelms me. It's got a real nice-sounding engine, right, Otto? 4.1-liter. - Digital fuel injection? - You got it. - Let's see what she got. - You the man. Give it some more. Give it some more. - Yeah, that's it! - Go! Go! - Let's go! - Come on. Baby, don't be so mean! - Yeah, that's it! - OK, yeah. That was good. Yeah, you break it, you buy it, my friend. Yeah, she got some power goin' on. All right. I'll catch you later, then. - It's on for tonight. - How do you know? They got the call signs of all the units working tonight. What were you gonna do with this? - I was gonna bonk it. - What? Bonk? For the next 24 hours, all your decision- making privileges have been removed! - You got it? - Got it. Yeah, that's cool, man.

Now, give me this! - What happened? - Where'd you get these from? - What's the problem? - The Mercedes are dirty! There are surveillance vans all over them. Where'd they come from? My guy in Southland. The same guy I used last time. Same guy I used before. - Before when? - When we took the other cars. - Other Mercedes. - Oh, Christ. Castlebeck. He got to one of the guys at the dealership and he turned him. - That's what happened. - Eight hours left. So, what? We're gonna stand around and have a meeting? What's going on? Memphis... Maybe it's time for us to start thinking about how to get these kids out of town... - Oh, man, you know what? No! That's... - What are you talking about? If there's no Mercedes, there's no point in boosting any other cars. You hear me? That's it. 47 is not 50, Memphis. You know that's what he'll say. Yeah.

Get in. Jesus Christ! Now what, man? What else? Fuzzy, you never called me. So now we gotta stay down here till you tell me everything you know. I told you everything I know. I know that, because I said, "This is everything I know." Detective Drycoff, does it seem like the suspect is violating his parole right now? Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck. if by violating his parole you mean failing to cooperate with a law enforcement officer. A little trick I learned in the car-thief retirement home. Could you hold this? No, no, no, I'm not failing to cooperate. It's just that... Yeah, OK, OK. Word has it that Kip Raines took the job, and he screwed up. He screwed up pretty bad.

We don't want anything to do with your turf. Something wrong with where we live, dog? No, no, it's cool for you. I mean, it's just not for us. So now you think you're better than us? Maybe we should cut you up, dog? - Dude, the keys. - Right. Excuse me a second, guys. Oh, man! - Oh, I'm gonna throw up, dog! - Man, that's disgusting.

I just don't abandon my friends. Oh, man, I ought to smack you silly, boy. You think your brother ran away? Is that what you think? You better get your story straight. Well, go on then. Straighten it out. Your mother told him to go. She knew if Memphis stayed, you were gonna walk his line. You were gonna join his crew. And she told him to pick up and go. And he did, thinking it was best for you. He left all of us... for you. Guess it wasn't that big a deal for him, though, really. Wasn't that big a sacrifice, leaving everything he'd ever known behind. And six years later, ain't life grand? You became a car boost anyway. How about that? I sedated him. He's sleeping.

It never rains but it pours. Son of a... Well, you know, I think you can thank your big brother. I think he just took your place under the guillotine. Sorry, mate. We're all done here. - No, we're not done. This is number 50. - You're late. So sod off. You got a problem with that, take it up with Calitri. - You're late. - Wait, wait. You're gonna argue with me over 12 minutes? I just stole 50 cars for you in one night, all right? I'm a little tired, I'm a little wired, and I think I deserve a little appreciation. I said 50 cars, not 49 and a half. 49 and a half? She's not so bad, man. She's got, what, you know, a lit... some paint and... You know, some fiberglass. Yes, indeedy. You know, and the book on her is 60, 70. Call it 80. So you take 80, all right? You subtract it from 200. All right? And we make a deal. You take 80 from 200 and we call it even. Done. All right. Good. And this thing with my brother is over. It's over. It's done. It's finished. Done. Finished. Nobody insults me. Nobody puts a gun to me head. Kill him. Shred the car. All right.

Everything's gonna be all right. We got it covered. Get my brother out of here. Hey. You made a mistake picking a kid to do your dirty work. Made an even bigger mistake picking my kid brother. And now you just made the biggest mistake tryin' to kill me. - No. Be careful with that. - This? - Just put it down. - That's right. You got a thing about wood. Just put it down. No. - No! No! - I'm-I'm... - No! - Oh, no. Go! Psst. I'm good. God! Jesus! God! - Who are you? - I'm a police officer. - Hey, you don't wanna do that now. - Yeah, I do. Listen to me. You walk out of here with me, you got some options. You kill me... now, you think about this... I'm a police officer, your life will be over. No, you've got that the wrong way round. If I kill you your life's over. Not all bad, though. Funeral will be on the telly. Everybody out there pressed and dressed. Guard of honor. Twenty-one-gun salute and the Stars and Stripes draped all over your coffin. It'll be the greatest day of your life. Here I am smack-dab in the middle of a moral dilemma, Randall. You've torn this town to shreds with that little escapade of yours, you and your Eleanor. But I understand what brought you back here. A brother's love is a brother's love. You saved my life, didn't you? - So what am I gonna do? - It's your call, Detective. Get outta here, Randall. I'll clean this up. Go, Randall, before I change my mind. Go. Oh, there's a container ship at pier 14. You might wanna check it out. Oh! Can a good-lookin', hard-workin' chef get a beer around here? Come on, Tumbler. You ain't doin' nothin'. Hand me a beer, baby. All right. Memphis? Guys? Food! - Thank you, sir. - Damn. Ow. Ow. Poor Toby, man. Sure looks like he's in a lot of pain. Hey, if that's pain, you can shoot me anytime. Sexy, sassy. If his unpleasant wounding has in some way enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his injuries carry with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory. We should all be so fortunate. You say, "Poor Toby." I say, "Poor us." - He spoke. - Yeah. Hey, man, I thought you were from Long Beach. Memphis. Hey. - I have something for you. - What is this? Open it. Keys. Keys are good. What do I do with them? Hey, everybody. Everybody, inside here. Let's go. Everybody, come on. Let's go! Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great pleasure... to present... - Oh, man! - Your very own Eleanor. - What? What? It's Eleanor! - Look at his face. All yours. It's a heap, but give me a couple of weeks and it'll look like a streamlined butterfly. - You didn't...? - Oh, no, no, no, no. I parted the chopper out for that. I'm blown away. You bought me a car. Well, yeah, you know, it's just a token of my appreciation for everything, you know. That's the way it should be. That's the way it should be. That's right. Yeah. Why don't you get in there and go for a ride? I know what you did. - And thank you. - I'll see you later, man. All right. Yes! - You wanna go for a ride? - Hell, yes. Oh, don't do this to me.
