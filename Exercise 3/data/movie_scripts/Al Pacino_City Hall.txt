New York City. So many things have been said about it... ... but there's only one I really like. "New York... ... it can destroy you or fulfill you, depending a good deal on luck. " No one should come here unless he's willing to be lucky. And I got lucky. I had an apartment downtown, but home was City Hall. That's where it all began. The day started out like other days, with a ceremonial function. The mayor was giving the key to the city to the governor of Tokyo. - He liked soup for breakfast. Fish soup. My dad offered to put it on the menu. But, "No, no," Mr. Hayatama said... ...who was a very gentle soul. "No, it would be too much trouble." My dad replied, "Too much trouble is no customers." The mayor, and he was the best mayor the city ever had, was my boss. I was his deputy mayor. His right-hand man. Or his boy... ... depending on who was talking about me. But in Brooklyn... ... something else was going on that would change everything. It started with a cop... ... Eddie Santos, the toughest detective in Brooklyn North. He was on his way to a meeting with Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer... ... whose only distinction was being a nephew to Paul Zapatti, a mafia boss. James Bone, a child on his way to school. Watch your step. Finally, Vinnie Zapatti, cousin to Tino... ... a rat Detective Eddie Santos had in his pocket. - All set? - Let's go. It happened on the corner of Broadway and Marcy in North Brooklyn. - You ain't going out in no playground. - Please? - No, it's raining too hard. - Oh, man. Here comes our boy. Get out of the car. You said you wouldn't take him in. Just want to talk with him. Turn him away from me. Keep up with me. You can move faster than that. Yo, Tino! - Hey, how you doing? - What's going on? I got something for you. What the fuck is wrong with you? Hey, Tino. Two men dedicated to the lives of their families... ...bridging the continents of Asia and Southern Europe... - Can it wait? - No, no, right now. Please. Two men, crossing two continents to meet in a third... ...as we have here today... ...the governor of Tokyo and the mayor of New York. Welcome to New York City... ...the sushi capital of the world. Welcome. Enjoy. Sayonara. We got a shootout... Kid's dead. So's the dealer. And the cop? Not good. Whose bullet killed the child? We don't know yet. What's our ETA? Bellevue in 10, sir. How old was the... What was it, a boy? Six years old. And what was our budget as of midnight? $31.7 billion. It costs a lot to have our children slaughtered in the streets. Coming through. Step back, please. How's he doing? Just coming out of surgery. - Coming through. - Give them room. Step back. All the way. Where's the widow? She's not a widow yet. You'll introduce me. Combat Cross, Medal for Merit... ...Honorable Mention, Department Medal of Honor. - Any kids? - Two. Five and three. A boy and a girl. Wife's name is Elaine. Elaine Santos. Which one is she? Don't point. In the red. The other's the sister. I'm John Pappas. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. If there's anything we can do... - Which one was the shooter? - They're both shooters. One's dead, one's almost. We know the dealer. Tino Zapatti. It's Paul's nephew. Punk. - What happened? - Don't know yet. Detective Santos was signed out, that we know. But he carried no radio, wore no vest. - Any backup? - Zero. Total breach of department policy. What was the guy doing? Taking a meeting with a drug dealer? You got me. But it adds up to a dead kid... ...and a dead nephew of the head of the Zapatti family. Here's a guy headed for... ...Attica on a 10 to 20, and he cops probation. Probation? No jail time? Probation's a sentence in New York these days. Which he skips out on 2 years later. We've been looking for him ever since. The mayor will want to step up for the wife. I wouldn't do that if I were him. And who are you, again? Internal Affairs. Listen... ...we can bury Santos. And if it turns out he was dirty, well... ...good cop turns bad. Happens all the time. Sure. We'll give him a full-dress funeral, to boot. Who is she? A lawyer for the Detective's Endowment Association. I guess she'll be representing Eddie Santos and his family. - I was wondering when you'd ask. - You don't have to wonder anymore. Stop. - Shock him. - Clear. He's flat. This city takes care of its own. Set a press conference for 12:00. Make sure the Post takes the first question. You know what the first question will be... ..."Whose bullet was it?" Call Senator Marquand, be cool. Tell him everything's under control. I'm just staying ahead of the curve. Abe, get a copy of Tino Zapatti's probation report. Which Zapatti is that? A nephew. One conviction, off on probation. A punk. We're headed for Park Drive. How's about we swing over to the FDR? We'll make better time. What's your pleasure? Where did the boy live? Give me a read on the boy's apartment. 515 South 5th Street. 5th Street. Marcy and Broadway. That's where we're going. We've got no advance, no protection. That's where we're going. I'm the mayor. Make room here, please. We need some help around here. - We need more police. - When you going to send us some help? Glad you're here, Mr. Mayor. The father's seated in the corner. I'm all yours, Leslie. Questions and answers. Who's up? - The Post. - Marx or Sadler? Sadler. Then I know what's coming. "Has probation become a sentence in this town?" Judge Stern has a powerful record. He served six years and meted out the stiffest punishments in the city. If the report recommends probation, then probation it has to be. After that, they'll start in on the mandatory crap. Good morning. I want to welcome the Revs. Williams and Birch... - You got the probation report? - In the office. I'll be there in a minute. - And my dear friend, Reverend Milton Parks... ...of the First Church of Harlem... ...Reverend Chapman and Reverend Murray. Thank you for coming here today. I know it wasn't easy for you. Well, what can I say? How do I start this? There is one thing, as Mayor... ...that I will never get over... ...and that is the death of a police officer. There is one thing in life that I will never get over... ...and that is the death of an innocent child. But this is an incident that won't go away... Tino Zapatti's probation report. The whole city... ... all parts of the city... ... Bushwick, Jamaica, Washington Heights... ... Brownsville, Harlem... This thing looks okay. Very okay. But there is a conviction. Criminal possession in the fourth degree. In the fourth degree. A 4-C. It's a probational offense. Practically a misdemeanor. Kevin, there are 4-Cs, and there are 4-Cs. You keep looking at that as if it weren't kosher. A cut of meat is kosher. A piece of fish. Savory foods are kosher. But a probation report is not kosher. A probation report is merely a probation report. I am a good Louisiana lapsed Catholic, Abe. Don't talk to me about kosher. Give it to me straight. What's wrong with this? It's too kosher. Translate that for me. The Virgin looks pregnant to me. Look. The supervisor signed this. So what? That's a lot of weight for a 4-C. So what happened... ...to the original little probation officer? Where is his signature? Do you know this supervisor? His name is Schwartz. - A landsman of yours? - Landsman... ...landsman. Stop trying your Yiddish out on me. You sound like a Shakespearean actor from a Savannah pogrom. - But do you know him? - Sure. But the trial was 2 years ago. I was long gone from the department. Hello, Larry. Good to see you. This is Deputy Mayor Calhoun. The first deputy mayor to set foot on this floor. We had a commissioner once, but it was the wrong floor. - May I have a seat? - Please, sit. Abe, you're already at home here. I think I know why you're here. I've logged 12 calls already. Tino Zapatti. - You want to know why I handled it. - Exactly. Because sometimes we get overloaded. And you take on the extras? The extra-specials. Such as Zapatti family members? Something like that. - Mr. Deputy Mayor... - "Kevin"'s good enough. Any case that comes here that looks like it's connected... ...I take a special interest in. - Why's that? - To avoid making mistakes. You sure made one on this. I blew one, okay? I don't mind admitting it. But let me tell you something. I'd rather blow one in 100... ...than send 10 men away on mandatories who don't deserve them. You sound like an enlightened man. And you sound like you're fucking with me. You have anything to add, Abe? It's okay. You're doing fine. Everybody will want to know how these things happen. How long have you been on this job? Three years. Look, these things happen... ...because we are awash here. In criminals, in half-baked social workers... ...in a city that doesn't function, in a world... ...that doesn't know right from wrong. - Mr. Schwartz? - Larry. I owe you an apology. No apologies. I came in here with a big head of steam. It was inappropriate. Look, it takes more than... ...3 years to get up to speed in this department. Only one man would have made a good probation officer: Kafka. And he wasn't available. Thank you, Larry. Call me if something opens up in the big building. You know, keep me in mind. He'll be right with you. South Brooklyn Democratic Club. I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever. Have your son stop by. I'll be happy to take care of it. Gussie, come on in. Hello, Mr. Anselmo. Thank you so much... ...for seeing me. - You look beautiful. - Thanks a lot. - Let me get that. It's my pleasure. So how can I help you? - They're going to throw me out. - Who? - Morty Brill. - No one'll throw you out. He says I'm under-occupied. Can I help it if my daughter moves out? Isn't she entitled to a life of her own? Of course. How is Helene? - Still working at the navy yard? - Thanks to you. So what can you do for me, Mr. Anselmo? Well, it's simple. See that Mr. Brill obeys the law. You're grandfathered in over there. If he says you're not, call me. A landlord like Morty Brill looks for ways around rent control. How would he understand a law meant for working stiffs like you and me? Thanks, Mr. Anselmo. Thanks a lot. Mr. Schwartz is right outside. Thanks, Clara. - I'm sorry. - Would you come speak to my club? Which club? Terrible Tiles Mahjong Club. How many Tiles belong? 112. You got it, sweetheart. - Just tell me when. - Fantastic! You'll come for dinner before? - I'll make a brisket. - I love brisket. Get home safe. Well, I'm taking a cab anyway. Thanks again. Hello, Larry. - I got to see you, Frank. - Well, here I am. How about a cup of coffee? No, thanks. We got to talk. Are you finished here? Well, the business of government... ...is never finished. Come on, let's take a walk. Mister A! How are you, Milton? I'm as corny as Kansas in August I'm as normal as blueberry pie No more a smart little girl With no heart I have found me a wonderful guy Speaking of blueberry pies... ...bring us a couple, Milton. You, � la mode? No, thank you. I don't want any pie. Apple for him. And coffee, Milt. - What's the matter? - You know, Frank. You look terrible. You should take a vacation. I don't want a vacation. I got 18 years in, you know? I save up my time. I put in my hours. I'm eligible for pension in 6 months. I don't want any vacation. So what is it? Get the deputy mayor off my ass. "Shrimpboats"? Him. Yeah. You couldn't handle him? It was easy. That's what I'm saying. It was too easy. Don't throw bouquets at me Don't please my folks too much Don't laugh at my jokes too much People will say we're in love What was that? Milton and I are great Rodgers and Hammerstein fans. "When you walk through a storm, keep your head up high." It's not your signature on the probation report. Now watch your mouth. That was quite a risk you took. The guy was wrong. No, Mayor. I don't care if he is from New York. Tells off a Cabinet member like that... ...he's your enemy for life. Secretary of Urban Development... ...that's the hand that feeds the cities. You know, Senator... ...they say a man's stature... ...is determined by his enemies, not his friends. It also got you the cover of Time. You're going national... ...Mayor Pappas. People magazine next. That "stature" thing. Who said that? I believe I did, a minute ago. I was having an acute attack of self-importance... ...but it's about to come to an end because here's the man... ...to cut me down to size. Kevin, we missed you. Sorry, folks. Didn't mean to interrupt you. Kevin's been busy today, I'll bet. This must be Mrs. Marquand. It's been quite a day for you. We don't want any stray bullets around Madison Square Garden. Ignore the senator. He keeps a little anchor to windward. Don't we all? Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day? The convention? We'll turn this city upside down for you. We'll stage the right kind of convention. What kind is that? The kind that'll reelect the President. Where will you go? Second cities, like Chicago? Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68? California? The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden, that nominates a Mondale. You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca. We'll make you a winner right here. You're not a New Yorker, are you? Ferriday, Louisiana. Huey Long country. "Every man a king," but no one wears a crown. I love this guy. Thank you so much. Lovely evening. Kevin, give me a call in the morning. I need some stuff for the New York Times. An editorial lauding our choice of convention city. The President loves a good Times editorial. - Let me assure you... - The vote's in. We got it. Let them catch their shuttle. I'm sure they're running late. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. MacNeil-Lehrer, Friday night. Zapatti's bullet killed the child. It wasn't the cop. That's it! That's what passes for good news these days. I'll take it. I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report. Exemplary, but an odd thing: It's front-loaded. - With who? - With supervisory personnel. But it's signed off on by an honest judge. - Judge Walter Stern? - Yes. Thank God. I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast. - Oh, good. Where? - Woerner's. Woerner's? - The hangout at Borough Hall? - That's it. When you go to Brooklyn, you're Frank Anselmo's guest. Don't piss up his leg. Just get him off this infrastructure thing. Nothing wrong with it... ...just unaffordable right now. Good work tonight. Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time. I think she collects them. National ink, the mother's milk of politics. Did I hear right, or did we get the convention? It's not signed and sealed... ...but it is delivered. And you were the closer. I thought I had him with the second city stuff. Of course you did. You know why? It belongs here. New York City. This is the place. Excuse me. All right, the story's on the 10:00 news. A little slow. A bullet took the life of an innocent 6-year-old... ... on his way to school during a police action. They're all over it like a cheap suit. It's going to stick to us like one too. 6- year-old James Bone... ... on his way to school. Ballistics from the police lab confirm... ... the wayward bullet that killed the boy came from Zapatti's gun... Here you are, Mr. Zapatti. Michael... ...find Vinnie. I want to have a little talk with him. Yesterday, on the corner of Broadway... ... and Marcy Street, gunfire broke out... ... claiming 6-year-old James Bone... ... along with 21-year-old Tino Zapatti... ... a convicted felon on probation... ... and a 32-year-old police detective, Eddie Santos. The Police Commissioner has disclosed... ... that an investigation is underway into Santos' activities. Question: What was Santos doing with a drug dealer... ... wanted for probation violations? Good morning. It will raise serious questions of corruption in the courts. Stern gave Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer... ... probation instead of sending him to prison. The question everyone is asking... ... because of this unusual disposition... ... is why did the judge do that? Good morning, Mrs. Santos. I'm Marybeth Cogan. We met at the hospital. That's Randy and Maria? These are my kids. - Please sit down. - Thank you. - I'm sorry to have to talk to you here. - It's all right. Hear from anyone in the department today? A couple of the guys. What did they say? I called to pick up his things from the precinct. They said his locker was sealed. But the captain came to see me. He was very nice. What captain? Homicide South. Eddie's commander. He's required to call on the widow. Is anything wrong? Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first. Okay? We're in the wrong business. You get lost? There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it. Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin. Kevin, this is Dan. Kevin, how are you? Tex, sit down. Take a load off. Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time. Can't take a joke? Jimmy! What'll you have? Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar. So what's new? I'll give you the headlines. Standard & Poor's going to lower the city's credit rating. We're going to close two firehouses. Results: 150 demonstrators at City Hall. The park commissioner has quit... ...to run the San Francisco Ballet. The stock exchange insists on leaving town. Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies. Plus a kid got shot. - And a drug dealer. - And a cop. No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn. Well, but... ...he's very welcome. The stock exchange, where are they removing to, my boy? White Plains, they mutter. They've been muttering that for years. One day they'll stop muttering and go. That's why we need city land for BankExchange. - No argument, Lenny. - And a subway stop. And an off-ramp from the expressway. The city's $25 billion in debt. We're in no position to build off-ramps. 3,000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop? What's your interest in this? Did you buy a few options around the city property? Of course he did. So did every other developer in town. Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor... ...if you don't transport their employees... ...BankExchange will dump this deal... ...and forget about New York... ...and put up their 60-story building in New Jersey instead. So be it. The mayor loves BankExchange, but can't afford infrastructure. You're flying in the face of real politics. Subways get people to jobs. Jobs mean votes. I thought John Pappas liked votes. He loves votes, Frank. But no infrastructure. Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp... ...it can't pay for them. - Where are you going? - I have an appointment in Manhattan. This meeting's over? I heard you say no. Can I offer you a ride? No, thanks. I make it quicker on the train. Here he comes. Judge Stern! Why did you give Tino Zapatti probation, your honor? Why did you go soft on the drug charge? Is probation a sentence in this town? They're burying little James Bone. Are you going to the funeral? Get me the file on Tino Zapatti. Mr. Deputy Mayor... ...l'm Marybeth Cogan. "Detectives Endowment Association, Legal Affairs, Co-Counsel." Very nice card. I represent Santos, and you're muddying my client's name. - Take it up with Corporation Council. - And get it buried? You should tell the mayor someone's taking him up the wrong street. Maybe we could explore this in more detail. Maybe over coffee. I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension. Why don't you wait in my office? No, I don't think so. I'll expect to hear from you in the morning. No, no, that's wrong. It won't go away unless you do something about it. This is a crisis that could derail us. The way Willie Horton sunk Dukakis... ...Tino Zapatti can sink us. Good afternoon. Where you been? My Brooklyn meeting. How'd it go? I think I just pissed up Frank Anselmo's leg. And? Felt good. Okay, Leslie. Tomorrow's Times, Post and News are all keeping the shooting... ...on the front page. What'd you expect? Nothing short of a triple axe murder will take it off. Keep feeding the press, morning and night. Emphasize our tough stand on crime. The 20% drop in homicides and street crime last year. Also, Stern's record. Hard-line. Good, Kevin. Corporation Council? We've commissioned a study that'll... ...prove this city has the toughest probation guidelines in the country. Excellent. Get Community Affairs involved. Tell Parks... ...clean up their playgrounds. Hover, nudge, show we care. And then we got to do something concrete. Something big, something important. Something that means jobs. That means building BankExchange. I won't let these shootings interfere with... ...my program for the city. I'm speaking at the boy's funeral. James Bone's funeral. That's a blueprint for trouble. I don't care. It's the right thing to do. I don't think you'll be welcome there. They got me anyway. Let's go to work. Kevin, I need you. So what happened? Frank Anselmo and his real-estate cronies is what happened. They want the subway stop to raise their land value on city property. The property around BankExchange? And? Anselmo said, "No subway stop... ...no BankExchange." - And you said? I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner... ...but we need BankExchange. We need jobs. We need that money going into the community. Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy... ...it's politically expedient. The hell with politically expedient. I'm talking about a 60-story building that will employ 3,000 people. It'll put food on the table. That's what counts. That's what we're about. That's BankExchange. That's all it is. You said we can't afford a subway stop. That'll take politics. More than one way to skin a cat. Get in there. Keep that staff fired up. You're the boss. What are you doing tonight? Hadn't thought about it. You ever see Carousel? The musical? You serious? A little before my time. You'll love it. Frank Anselmo will be there. I'm free. George... ...Frank Anselmo's in there. Tell him to come up. I want to see him in the lobby. Just list them for me. That's all. Let me get back to you. We're missing the best part. You know it by heart. I saw you lip-synching. Well, lucky I do. I couldn't hear all the words. I don't know if it's my old ears, or the subway underneath. - Did you like the Billy Bigelow? - He's good. Good voice. What'd you think of the Julie Jordan? Good act, no voice. My Nettie could sing better. We met 25 years ago, Westbury... I heard about that. Speaking of performances, Frank. I don't want to hear about another one like this morning. Your boy embarrassed me. You'll have to live with it. - Why? - Because he's my boy. There's oil... ...under that vacant lot, Frank. Jobs. You don't need to politic me. I run Kings County. Jobs for people of this city. Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals. Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President... ...you're going to forget who got you here? I don't forget anything. You're developing a short memory. Or a selective one. You want me to refresh it for you? I'm sorry, John. Here it is. The off-ramp costs me five million. Another $35 million for the subway stop. You'll get some from me. The rest I got to beg Albany. I got better things to beg for from Albany. I got a solution. How about a spur... ...off the Canarsie Line? - Are you crazy? A spur is $ 120 million a track mile. BankExchange is good for the poor. It's good for the jobless. It's good for the whole city. As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps... ...we can't afford it. Then, you'll have to forget the whole thing. I love the second act opener. Then you won't want to miss it. "This Was a Real Nice Clambake." I'm building up my IOU's with Albany. The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop... ...or I won't support him for reelection. And the off-ramp? Next year. - It's already in my budget. - Next year's too far. You're only a boss, Frank. I'm the fucking mayor. Mayors rule. BankExchange. My way or the highway. Why do I get the feeling you're getting the bigger half? Let me ask you something. If I'd have offered you less... ...would you have been polite and taken it? Of course. You got what you wanted. I like to kiss the pretty ones. There's another pretty one. You got BankExchange. - How did you know? - I saw the kiss. I saw the smile. How'd you get it? I didn't say no. But he'll take a bath on those leases. It'll just take him longer. - Something for him, something for me. - More for you? No, no. More for the city. Hey, cigar. Sneaking in a drink for Sydney? I was. Now they're both for me. Helps Frank Anselmo go down. Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for. But I'm left holding the bag. What are you complaining about? The bag's full of cash. Minus a year. You can weather a year. You can weather 100 years. I've got partners. You're my partners. You're holding so many options on land... ...you could buy Brooklyn. You could probably buy Staten Island too. Would you excuse us, please? Of course. I got an appointment anyway. Good. Then it works out nicely. You sure BankExchange is all set? We got everything we wanted. Now you can get something else for me. - What's that? - My name out of the papers. How? With $40,000. What am I going to do with $40,000? Let me ask you a question. You ever heard of a cop with $40,000? Who wasn't crooked? A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines. Say hello to Nettie for me. I will. - Take care. - All right. That's for the dead cop. Reverend Chapman will introduce me? With one sentence. And then what? Get out of here. - And which way is that? - Side door. No. Out the front. Is that a good idea? Intel's out there and they say people aren't happy. Sisters... ...brethren. The mayor of the city of New York... ...the Honorable John Pappas. Thank you, Reverend. I was warned not to come here. I was warned. They warned me... ..."Don't stand behind that coffin." But why should I heed such a warning... ...when a heartbeat is silent... ...and a child lies dead? "Don't stand behind... ...this coffin." That boy was as pure and as innocent... ...as the driven snow. But I must stand here because... ...I have not given you... ...what you should have. Until we can walk abroad and recreate ourselves... ...until we can stroll along the streets... ...like boulevards... ...congregate in parks... ...free from fear... ...our families mingling... ...our children laughing, our hearts joined... ...until that day, we have no city. You can label me a failure... ...until that day. The first and perhaps only great mayor... ...was Greek. He was Pericles of Athens... ...and he lived some 2,500 years ago... ...and he said... ..."All things good... ...of this earth... ...flow into the city... ...because of the city's greatness." Well... ...we were great once. Can we not be great again? I put that question... ...to James Bone... ...and there's only silence. Yet... ...could not something... ...pass from this sweet youth to me? Could he not empower me... ...to find in myself... ...the strength... ...to have the knowledge... ...to summon up the courage... ...to accomplish this seemingly insurmountable task... ...of making a city livable? Just livable? There was a palace... ...that was a city. It was a palace. It was a palace and it can be a palace again. A palace in which there is no king, or queen... ...or dukes, or earls, or princes, but subjects all. Subjects... ...beholden to each other to make... ...a better place to live. Is that too much to ask? Are we asking too much from you? Is it beyond our reach? Because if it is... ...then we are nothing but sheep... ...being herded... ...to the final slaughterhouse. I will not go down that way. I choose to fight back! I choose to rise, not fall. I choose to live, not die. And I know... ...I know that what's within me... ...is also within you. That's why... ...I ask you now... ...to join me. Join me. Rise up with me. Rise up on the wings... ...of this slain angel. We'll rebuild on the soul... ...of this little warrior. We will pick up his standard... ...and raise it high. Carry it forward... ...until this city... ...your city... ...our city... ...his city... ...is a palace again! Is a palace again! I am with you, little James. I am you. Thank you very much. Terrible thing to bury a child. Your trip to Washington. The stuff for the Convention Committee. History of New York City for Senator Marquand. Reservation at the Willard Hotel. Lincoln stayed there, by the way. Enough about me. Enough about me. What are you going do tonight after I'm gone? I don't know. I hadn't thought about it. You're going to get yourself a good meal. You're going to pass up that double cheeseburger from Roy Rogers. You're going to go to Dominic's and get take-out, on me. Get a decent meal. But before you go to Dominic's, go to Macy's... ...and get a chair... ...with legs and arms. That apartment of yours... ...looks like it belongs in a homeless file. Then it's off to Crate and Barrel for a knife... ...a fork, a spoon... ...and a glass while you're at it. Then I'll need a dishwasher. Just throw them out after you finish eating. It's on me. Get a life. I've got yours. It's quite enough. You read this? Today's Times editorial? "Judge or be Judged"? "Notwithstanding Judge Stern's distinguished record... ...one must ask, 'Would he be on the bench... ...if he were not a former law partner of the mayor's? '" I didn't appoint him. He was nominated, like everybody else. Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges. Whose side are you on? I'm on yours... ...and I always will be. But I smell a hanging party. We should put distance between ourselves... ...and Walter Stern. - Distance is shit. Distance! Distance is something you do to your enemies. It's the thing of the '90s to make friends extinct. Distance... ...is the absence of Menschkeit. Translate that for me. You don't know what Menschkeit means? I don't. Menschkeit. You know, something between men. It's about honor, character... Untranslatable. That's why it's Yiddish. I didn't know you'd taken up the language. Abe laid it on me. Abe's a good man. You're a good man, Pappy. Underneath that Louisiana... ...cane syrup... ...plain red dirt. Not that different from the pavements of Astoria, where I'm from. You and me... ...are sticking by... ...Judge Walter Stern. Man, thou art dust... ...and to dust... ...thou shalt return. If there's anything I can do... ...please feel free to call. - Thank you. - It's the least we can do. Good morning. Where's the mayor? He had to go Washington on convention business. This rates an inspector's funeral and that includes the mayor. The mayor's absence in no way diminishes his concern... ...for Mrs. Santos and her children. Where'd they get all that stuff from in the newspapers? At school they tell my girl her daddy was a drug dealer. We'll get our press people right on it. What about Internal Affairs? What are those clowns doing? Where you going? - City. - I thought we were in the city. Not if you're from Queens. Let's start over. Where you going? Manhattan. Hop in. Go fuck yourself. Not to be disrespectful... ...but the Transportation Department... ...wasn't prepared for 1,000 people. 999. We were expecting the mayor. You're just going to wait for an hour... ...then ride a bus, then slepp on a subway... Schlep. "Schlep." Not "slepp." "Schlep." Get the gumbo out of your Yiddish. How do you feel about the L.I.E.? I hate the L.I.E. Take the Grand Central. Catch it at Astoria Boulevard. Go ahead, I'll show you. Santos was a good cop. You're doing a vile thing. It's wrong... ...to blame a dead cop and steal a widow's rights. You keep saying that. Nobody's doing anything. You've got all the answers. Don't even have the questions yet. Well, I got a question for you. You hungry? Swing by that diner up there. The North Star. Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City. Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches? Who we going to meet here? What are you talking about? You surface in front of my car at the cemetery. You show just enough leg so I'd stop. And the Grand Central is the long way around. Who we going to meet? Albert Holly. He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation. Thank you. Eddie got ahold of something, he wouldn't let go. Eddie Santos was a pit bull. Pit bulls are ugly, but they're not stupid. What was he doing without backup? It wasn't the first time he'd taken Tino down. He'd never had a problem with him before. Somehow, Tino must have got the drop on him. It happens. Why didn't he tell anyone he was going up there? Because it was his collar. He made that case against Tino, then the judge went south. There is no way Tino Zapatti could have walked two years ago unless... ...unless interested parties... ...had the judge in their pocket. Walter Stern is a jurist of national reputation. I don't care if he's Oliver Wendell Holmes. Somebody got to him. And based on that one interview... ...you were able to come to the conclusion stated in your testimony? That, and the VA records, yes. Do you mind passing this on to the judge? Based on only one interview? The defendant has a lengthy, documented case... Please answer the question. - Would you restate the question? - All right. Based on that one interview... ...you were able... Where are you going with this? Your Honor, the witness interprets the defendant VA record one way... ...our psychologist interprets it another.
