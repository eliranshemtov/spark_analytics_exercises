Ladies and gentlemen, this is Simon Barsinister, the wickedest man in the world. He was evil and crazy. Simon and his wacky henchman, Cad, schemed to rule the universe. But each time they were foiled by me, the greatest superhero who ever lived... Underdog! Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you this evening to discuss the growing problem of crime in our city. Here in front of me are files of unsolved cases. We're getting ahead of ourselves. That's me in the uniform. I was raised, since I was just a little puppy, to fight crime. Never had a family or a place to call home. I was raised with one purpose and one purpose only: To help people, to keep them safe. Nothing was going to stand in my way. Easy, boy. - However, to the families involved... - You got something, boy? What was that? Alpha Dog has got a lock on the stage. I think it's the boxes. Criminals should not be allowed to keep their freedom. Clear the building! We need SWAT here, now! Please hurry, your honor. Everybody out! Blue team, go, go! Move! No radiation. No metal. Tweezers, and we'll lift. Easy. Right down the side. Yeah. Slow. And slide. I bet you didn't know a beagle's sense of smell is 55 times stronger than a human's. Well, mine's not. It's a gift from the American Pork Association. I want a full debrief, now. Nice work, rookie. You found an exploding ham. Quiet, I smell a bomb. You! You should just turn in your tags. All right, I'll be honest with you. I wasn't the best dog on the force. In fact, I was probably the worst. The ham was just the latest of my mistakes. Like the time I chewed the extension cord and it was plugged in. Or when I met that cute poodle and it turned out to be a guy. It's hard to feel destined for greatness when you keep messing up. But, destiny's a funny thing. It'll creep up on you when you least expect it. Gotcha. Last one for tonight. Excuse me. Uh, there's been a big mistake. I'm not a stray. I shouldn't be in the pound. This ain't no pound, son. This place makes the pound look like the dog park. By day it's OK, but at night, once everyone's left, that's when the freaky stuff happens. What kind of "freaky stuff?" - What did they do to your hair? - What's wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nothing at all. You were saying about the "freaky stuff." All I'm saying is when the guy in the white lab coat pulls out the giant needle, run! Hey. Welcome to the graveyard. Yeah, nice and quiet, just like I like it. Uh, sir, excuse me. We're not open right now. There's no access to the labs. Oh, really? I'm sorry. That's all right. Don't worry. Oh, wait. What's this? What does this say? Uh... "All Access." Sorry. It's OK. You all make mistakes. But I forgive you. Because that's the kind of person I am... humble. A humble genius. It's OK. Let him in. Please. Again, I'm sorry, Dr. Barsinister. - I'm terribly sorry. - It's OK. How were you to know that I am the most important scientist this company has? You couldn't have. - Who's the new hire? - Him? He, uh, used to be a cop. I was thinking that maybe we should take it easy on the after-hours stuff. You know? Clandestine. A three-syllable word? I'm impressed. I bought a, uh... ...thesaurus. Good for you. But even if he is an ex-cop, we don't have time to skulk about. Look. "Police Dog Training." It's a great idea. Why didn't you think of that? Because training is a fool's process. I've met with the mayor, and I told him how we could take this city to new heights through genetic manipulation. - Yeah? What did he say? - The fool actually laughed at me. That happened to me once. I had my pants on inside out. Nobody told me for the entire day. - Stop talking now. - Oh, right. Right. I'll be the silent partner. Just because you're the only one here, Cad, does not make us partners. Wow. A real-life mad scientist. Yeah, and he ain't even mad yet. All right. Bring me the new dog. Your lucky day. And now, the most important DNA. Oh. Don't worry, little guy. It will only hurt... a lot. OK, let's do it, partner. Gross! Your mouth was open! Just hold him. Hey, Doc! Get him! Get in the game, Doc. He's right there. No, no! No, no! My research! - The serum. - He's going for the door! Run, boy. Run, run! Bring me a chew toy from the outside. And maybe some hair gel! It works. Doc! I'm pulling the security tapes and running a computer sweep - of Dr. Barsinister's research. - Dan, we'll handle it from here. When there's a crime, they call a cop. When someone wants to sign into the building, they call you. Right. That's why you're the chief. With a big filing cabinet marked "unsolved crimes." Hey, guys... Yeah, that was some night. I was homeless and hungry. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, these numbskulls show up. Hey, runt. You lost? - The name's Riff Raff. - He's Riff Raff. - I've marked this territory. - Yeah, he marked it. Look, I don't want any trouble, OK? Well, then today's your lucky day, mutt. I'd rip you to pieces, but I don't want to get my paws dirty. Yeah. You're not worth his time, fleabag. - Fleabag. Yes. - Get him! Sweet. We're going to get him. Come back here! That mutt dumped my trash. Come on. Get him, boys. - He thinks he's a greyhound. - Look at him go. I'll eat that runt for dinner. Dibs on leftovers. Oh! Speed bump. - What a way to go. - I'm with you, boss. Let's get out of here. Hello? Hey, I thought I clipped you. What are you doing? You're a funny little dog. Come here. Come here. Let me see. Where's your collar? Oh, is that a kiss? Where's your collar? You don't have a home? Why don't you come home with me? Huh? We got a nice home, just for you. What are you doing out that window? I know what you're thinking. He just hit me with his car, and I climb in the front seat. Look, I may not be able to smell a bomb, but I can smell a good person. Please excuse Jack Unger from any and all activity because he has a bad cold. No, too simplistic. He has shingles. No, I already used that. Come on, Jack. Dig deep. I got one. Perfect. Hey, Jack, you ready for school yet? - Yeah. - Come on out back. - I can't. I'm busy. - Aw, come on. I got something to show you. Hey, I heard that. Yeah, you're a good dog. Can you sit for me? Oh. God bless you. Here's your ba... Hey, Jack. Look. - You bought a dog? - No, I didn't buy him. I, uh, I found him on the street. He's cute, isn't he? I thought maybe we'd go for walks, take him on a hike. Hikes? Oh, fun. Hey, look at that. I think we should call him... Shoeshine. Considering all the other things he probably licks, I think that's the best call. Jack, I just thought he would be good for you. Take your mind off a few things. Listen, I'm telling you I am fine, all right? - OK. - You don't have to keep doing this. You've got other things to worry about, like being a prison guard to lab rats. You know what? I like the new job. If you don't want the dog, I'll take him to the pound this afternoon. Hello? No, no, I'll come back. All right. Thank you. I got to go back to work. - What about Shoelick? - Shoeshine. Listen, do me a favor. Keep an eye on him. You know what? Give him a chance. - You might even like him. - I don't think so. All he does is eat, sleep and poop. Then the two of you have a lot in common, don't you? I can isolate specific protein strands in animal DNA. Then combine them any way I want. This will give him the speed of a cheetah, the ability to fly like an eagle, or the strength of an animal one hundred times his weight. Forging a doctor's note, Jack? Is this what it's come to? I didn't forge it. So, you expect me to believe that you have... "monkeypox?" It's pretty bad. OK. I don't know what disappoints me more, the fact that you did it, or that you did so poorly that you couldn't even fool a P.E. Teacher. Ahhh. Food. Yep. Definitely smell food. Hmm. It's not dog food, but it's about to be. Oh, no. They're going to blame this on me. Oh, well, bon app�tit. A- ha. Homo postalis, the Great North American Mailman. Natural enemy of the dog. Look, the Ungers got a new cat. Come on. Come on, come on. Is that the best you got? You want a piece of this here? Whoa. That's right. Run, mail-slinger, run. And never come back here again. Great. Two for one. Hey. Is that a tennis ball? This day just gets better and better. Whoa! That couch tried to kill me. There is something mighty peculiar going on here. Huh? What did you do? Dad is going to kill you. And then me. Oh! I really hope this is chili. Give me a break. It was an accident. Hello? Dad? Is that you? Hello? Come here, boy. - Did you hear something? - No. Did you? - Did you just talk? - Huh? What? Hmm? Whoa, whoa... Wait a minute. You can understand me? OK. OK. Deep breaths. Get some fresh air to the brain. You're just imagining this. - Wait. You... - Bad dog. Stop talking. Wait. Stop. Person, heel. Come on, who trained you? Person, just wait. - What did you just call me? - Sorry. I don't know your name. Jack. Nothing. Stop talking to me. Look, I can't stop talking to you, Jack Nothing, because I'm freaking out here. If we're going for a walk, you may want to get a poop bag. - What? - I have that special feeling. Maybe you're the problem. A weirdo kid who can suddenly talk to dogs. How did you learn to speak English? - How should I know? - Can you speak other languages? A little retriever. Some shih tzu. My Chihuahua is a little rusty, though. - OK, I mean other human languages. - So English isn't enough for you? Jack? Shh! That's Molly, a reporter for the school paper. She'll have a field day with you. Just speak dog. Arf. Arf. - Hey, how�s it going? - Good. - Were you just talking to someone? - Just my dog. I've got my dog, too. Polly! OK, here we go. Uh, hello. I'm Shoeshine. Oh, well, hello. I'm Polly. I think she likes him. I've never seen you. Are you new to this park? Oh, yeah, I just, uh, relocated. You smell wonderful. Like a half-eaten pig's ear. Excuse me. "Pig's ear?" Is that what passes for a pick-up line? No, no. I, uh... Well, I've got to get going. Come on, Polly. - Master calls. - So, uh, will I see you again? Look, you're a cute beagle and all, but I want a little pizzazz in a relationship. A guy who can sweep me off my feet, you know? - Hmm... - But we can be friends, OK? - See you later. - Yeah. See you later. "Friends?" "Friends?" I don't want to be friends. I'm looking to settle down, to find Mrs. Right. She could be Polly Shoeshine. Or is it Polly Shine? Or is it... Hey, Frisbee! - What was that? - It's my instincts. I just can't help myself. Whoo! What a rush. OK. What else do you do? Now bury the bone. Let's go. Good boy. Bury the bone. Uh, excuse me. You want to tell me why you're talking to me like that? What? It's doggy talk. Well, it's demeaning. Give me the stick. - Hey, I think I struck oil. - Shoeshine, get out of there. Come on. I hope no one saw that. What else do dogs do? Hey, they smell. - How�s your smelling? - My schnoz ain't too good. Got me fired from my last job. That's ridiculous. Come on, just try it. Smelling makes me nervous, and I... Ah... ah... ah-choo! Glad I didn't try to hold that one in. I would have blown my brains out of my ears. OK. Um, what are they saying? ...When I talk like that. I'm not gonna spend... I know. We'll talk later. Bye. Catch the ball right in the web of the glove. Maybe we should see other people. He thinks it would be better if they saw other people. She says for all she cares he can go eat... People eat that, too? Help! Let me go. It's Polly and that girl who follows her around. - Molly. - She's with two other guys. They're stealing her backpack. This way. Hey! Wait. - Slow down. - No, you speed up. Use all four legs. This is incredible. I've never run this fast before. It feels like my feet aren't even touching the ground... Yeow! Whoo! I can fly? Hey! Whoa! Look out! Whoo! This is way better than sticking your head out of a moving car. Whoo hoo! Oh, no! I'm blind. I can't see. Oh, no. I don't want to see. Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Out of the way. I'm good. I'm good. Whoo! Spicy mustard. Ow! Where are the brakes on this thing? - I got a camera. - Hurry up. Whoo! Whoa! Ahhh! Hello? 911? Uh-huh. Someone just swooped in and saved you? You think you could describe him? Yes. He was white. - Molly, hey. Um, are you all right? - Mm-hmm. - OK, so he's a Caucasian? - Actually, I think he was brown. He was light brown with white spots on his belly, paws and tail. He had black whiskers, brown eyes and a wet nose. Like this? Shoeshine? Shoeshine. Shoeshine, you here? Sorry, Jack. I didn't mean to break those cars or those garbage cans or that building. Shoeshine, you're a hero. No, I don't want to be a hero. I'll screw it up. Trust me on this one. I just wanted a home, a place where I belonged. Just because I have these powers doesn't make me a hero. Shoeshine, it depends on what you do with them. Maybe. But promise me, no one can find out. - Not even your dad. - Oh, my dad. Easy. Easy. Do you see a tennis ball anywhere? Just put it in the corner. You know, traditionally, the dog makes the mess and the human cleans it up. I'm looking for my beagle. He, uh, does tricks and stuff. I'm... I'm sorry. I haven't seen him. - What was that? - That was my, um... my grandpa. He's blind, and we're just rearranging the furniture. - Are you all right in there, Gramps? - Who you calling Gramps? Get back in here and help me move the couch. You're making your blind grandfather move a couch? It was either that or repave the driveway. His choice. Good luck finding your dog. - Do you belong to that guy? - What? Me? No. - Then who was he? - How should I know? All you humans look alike. Oh, it's my dad. OK. I'm going to go out there and stall him, and you try and make things look as normal as possible in here. Talking dog will try to make things normal. Check. All clean. - Dad, Dad, hey. - Hey, how are you? What's up? - Do you need help? - Sure, yeah. Thanks. Wait. I'm going to put these inside, and then we're going to go for a walk. A walk? You and me are going to go for a walk? Yeah. You know, just chill, talk? Hang out? OK. Come on. What happened there? - Dad, wait. - No, Jack. What? Yeah, hang out. - Dad, look, I can explain. - Don't tell me the dog did it. We'll talk about it later. I'm going to take that dog to the pound. Dad, no! No, please. I want to keep him. You told me you didn't want the dog. Me? No way. I told you I've wanted a dog since I was, like, eight. All right, but it's your responsibility. You got to feed it, brush it, walk it. You got to train it. Trust me, Dad. This dog will do things that will blow your mind. This better be chili. Yes. Yes, brilliant. Already the flames of inspiration are licking at my brain. Unencumbered, in this, my new laboratory. - Kind of smells like a men's room. - So much the better. It seems like the wrong vibe for our work. Seems a little precocious. - Perspicacious. - What? Peppery? Prim? Most of my thesaurus burned up in the fire. All I've got left are the P's. - Perfect. - Ooh. That's a good one. Can I use that? The material I require is going to be expensive. We're going to need to find ways to subsidize my work. I know some guys who just got out of the clink who can help us. Perhaps. Bam! - Ahhh! - Nailed it. Jack and I became good buddies. For the first time in my life, I really felt like Man's Best Friend. Hot dogs, nice and hot! Come on. Bite into a nice juicy hot dog. What? What? Oh, my gosh, they're made of dog! Are you people crazy? Shoeshine, come here. It's not real dog. - What is it then? - It's just animal parts. You know, like noses, hooves, intestines. Well, in that case, I'll take two. Hot dogs! Hot dogs! That's what I got! Hot dogs! Hot dogs! Nice and hot! - Why is he talking like that? - He's rhyming. It's a gimmick. To get people's attention. That seems like a strange convention for you to mention. And this is where I'm bored out of my mind, eight hours a day. Whenever I'm bored I just chase my tail. If you're lucky you throw up and bingo! Lunch, part two. - Nice. - What? Sticks, balls, and running in one game? - So clever. So inspired. - Not our team. We're always the underdogs. Never heard of that breed. Is that a dog from Australia? No. Look, an underdog is someone Who has been counted out and nobody expects them to win. Yeah, I know the feeling. Huh? There goes the neighborhood. Shoeshine, no. - Freak. - What? See? - So, what's the score? - I told you no. But every molecule of me was screaming "yes." It's time to teach you some manners. Right. I'm going to learn manners from a guy who pees in my white porcelain drinking bowl. All right. Basic commands. Chapter one: Sit. Let's start with a tough one. - Chapter two: Lie down. - Fine. I was going to do that anyway. Chapter three: Roll over. This book doesn't have much of a plot, does it? And chapter four: Speak. Arf. Arf. You can't be serious with this. Four weeks of lessons in four seconds? We're on a good pace. Chapter five: Return the book and get your money back. - I got you something. - Oh. Never had one of these before. If you ever get lost they'll know where to bring you home. "Home." Wow, this is great! Oh, ew! Oh, that breath is horrible. What have you been eating? Not sure. I dug it out from under the house. Suddenly I had a home and a family. I had all that I ever wanted. The only thing that could mess this up was if a mad scientist bent on revenge was living underneath the city. Well, guess what? Oh, the price I've paid. So be it. Hi. How�s it going? I'd love to, baby, but I'm busy. Work out? Yeah, I work out. I think of my body as a Buddhist temple. Cad, stop talking to your imaginary friend and get in here! Dan, it's Les. You got a shipment at the loading docks. - Can you buzz them in? - All right. I'm on my way. Is this thing going to help us make another super dog? Why settle for just one when I can create a plethora? That's a "P" word. I bet I have that one. Just pick it up, you ape. Give the dog your food. Give the dog your food. Give the dog your food. You are in my power. You will do as I command. Sorry, you didn't get the power of hypnotism. A- ha. Not yet, I didn't. Give the dog your food. Rubber? What kind of sick joke is this? ...this demonstration will convince international leaders that the Capitol City K-9 Academy is the future for K-9 crime fighters. Maybe I should sign you up. I don't think that's a good idea. My dad used to be on the force. He was twice decorated by the mayor for bravery. - He was a real hero. - What happened? He quit. - That a big deal? - A big deal? Yeah. OK, he says he quit his job to spend time with me after my mom died, and he's still never home. We're interrupting with breaking news. One of our camera crews following police have stumbled upon a jewelry store robbery. The thieves have taken several hostages. You never see dogs hurting each other for money. You never see people sniffing each other's butts. Mmm, touch�. As you can see, it is a tense situation. Hey, you can stop it, like with Molly and Polly. No, no, no way. Uh-uh. That was an accident. I had no idea what I was doing. Well, maybe this is why you're here. Look, I was just getting the hang of the whole "pet" thing. - I even chewed up your iPod. - You what? The truth is, I just want to be a regular dog. And I want to be a regular kid with a mom and a dad. But you know what, life doesn't always work out that way. All right. I'll do it, for you. But just this once. There better be something pretty special in that dog dish when I get back. You can put the dog door there! - Whoa! - Shoeshine! - Watch out for the fish kite. - What fish kite? Ohhh! I'm good. I hope I don't look too ridiculous. Oh! - No! - Hey, come on. Don't look at me. If she hadn't pulled the silent alarm, you two wouldn't be getting a time out. - Got it. - We got it. Good. Unit 31, I hear you loud and clear. They got all the exits barricaded. We can't get a man in there. Hold your positions. SWAT is on its way. ETA five minutes. - Did you see that? - I have no idea. Whoa! Ow! Dogfish. Excuse me. Why do you people have pantyhose on your heads? I'll get him. I'm going to guess you're one of the bad guys. Huh? Cad, can you hear me? That's our dog! - Grab him! - OK. Hey, you, grab that dog. Are you all right? Are you OK? Can you hear me? Come on, little buddy. Breathe. Hey, guys, back off. He needs some space. I'll give you some space. I said give me some space. Hang tight, little buddy. I'll get some help. Evening, officers. - Whoa, whoa. Hold your fire. - The jewels are safe, there's a fox passed out on the floor, and, yes, I'm dressed like a fish. Keep up the good work.
