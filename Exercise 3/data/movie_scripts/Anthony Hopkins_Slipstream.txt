Did you get through to Sandra? No. No, I Ieft her a message, toId her we'd be there around 4:00, 4:30, and that tomorrow we'd take her to a magic show. What did she say? I toId you she wasn't there. - It's so hot. - You want some water? Your UncIe Bernie used to say I was Iike a cat on a hot tin roof, Iike EIizabeth TayIor in that picture with Richard Burton. - PauI Newman. - Who? PauI Newman.

For you, sir? We're making IittIe Bonnie nervous, Fat Man. Are we making you nervous? We're reaI sorry, Bonnie. Look, I don't want any troubIe. Who's causing troubIe? I know what it is. She thinks you're Dr. PhiI. It's making her aII of a dither. You think I Iook Iike Dr. PhiI, Bonnie? - ProbabIy turning her on. - I don't know, sir.

So siIIy. - What's your name, baby doII? - Joanie. That's what you've been drooIing over so IustfuIIy. Joanie. Ain't that cute. LittIe sad, too, now I gotta be honest. StiII wanna be Mommy's IittIe treasure? Am I right? Not quite ready to Iet go of aII your IittIe girIy yesterdays? Pretty soon, sweetie pie, you're gonna have to give up aII that shit when you join the festering parade of tired oId broads... the Bette Anns, the Mary Lous, the Patsys, the Cindys... the Bonnies. Just taIking about you. Come on, get a move on! Boo Boo tends to get a IittIe snarIy when he hasn't eaten, right, Boo Boo? So we got the Joanies, the Bonnies, and we got the Bettes. How you doing, oId gaI? It is Bette, isn't it? Not ''Bett''? And her name's Gina, right? Good morning. Or shouId I say, good afternoon. HeIIo. What's your probIem, pointy head? Got no probIems. Then what are you staring at? Nothing. Heck of a Iot of staring going on in this pIace, eh, Boo Boo? Makes me feeI reaI itchy and twitchy aII over. You don't have to be sorry. Be conscientious, be American, with American vaIues--industry, vaIor! That's what I Iike to see. That's aII I ask of my feIIow Americans. ''I am not a crook!'' Bonnie, where's my friend's breakfast? I'm just preparing it now. Good! Continue the preparation. - What is your name, pinhead? - MeI. That's an aII-American name to me, MeI. Got a ring of authenticity. Kinda cracker barreI, know what I mean? ChiII WiIIs, SIim Pickens, Andy Devine, and Big Mac MeI. Nice cozy IittIe setup you got here. TeII me something, if you're not too much of a whacked-out oId fairy: what exactIy is your reIationship to sweet Bonnie Daydream, here? - Nothing. - She your IittIe piece of ass? I'm gonna keep my eye on you, MeI baby. Bonnie, come on out. MeI, this way. MeI, Iet me introduce you to Abe Geekman. His friends, and in this regard I wouId count myseIf as one of his cIosest and dearest buddies, caII him Geek. Hi, gang. You okay, Geek, oI' SnuggIy Boo? Let's put up the CIosed sign on the oId diner door and keep out Mr. Forest Ranger, Boo Boo? - I sure did, Yogi. - Smart IittIe bear, Boo Boo. Come on. Now that we're aII snug and cozy, Iike...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven IittIe peas in a pod... Speaking of pods reminds me: you guys ever see lnvasion of the Body Snatchers? Long time ago? Anyone? No? Never saw it. How 'bout that, Geek? They never saw lnvasion of the Body Snatchers. That is so sad. lnvasion of the Body Snatchers! For pete's sake, never saw that? - It's a great movie. - Kevin McCarthy was the star. - And Dana Wynter. - Oh, beautifuI Dana-- What's with you peopIe? It's Geek's favorite movie. We watch it every Thanksgiving. And Fourth of JuIy. See, it stars Kevin McCarthy. He was a big star back in the '50s, and I met him once in New York a Iong time ago. You never toId me that, Geek. Yeah, he gave me his autograph, gave me a picture. Lucky son of a gun. He amazes and astonishes me, my oId paI. You're a reguIar oId sIy boots, aren't you? Look at him. He's bIushing, Iike ''Aw, shucks'' bIushing. My oId paI, a reaI sIy boots. Anyway. Where was I? Body snatchers, these peopIe Iived in giant pea pods, you see? - Dinner's ready. - The movie is about these pod peopIe who invade us from outer space. Right, these creatures, these parasites, 'cause that's what they are. Goddamn parasites. These parasites take over the bodies and souIs of feIIow traveIers, - good, decent peopIe. - Compassionate, caring, sharing, Iike you and me. Men, women, piddIing oId grandpappies, - decaffeinated pussies. - You and me. Decaffeinated pussies. - Men and women... - UncIe Ira mowing his Iawn. And aII the Aunt Beas from aII the Mayberrys. - TaIk show hosts and anchormen... - Geek. Sorry, anchorpersons. - He is so bad. - Sorry, foIks. PeopIe Iike Larry King Live, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Dan Rather, PauIa Zahn, Katie Couric, Martha Stewart. - Everyone from Oprah to-- - DonaId Trump. Fire! They take over the bodies and souIs of peopIe, and you know what? They become them. First we had the Trekkies... ...now we have the Poddies... and they run the whoIe goddamn show. - You want to know why? - Why? 'Cause they are mainstream. Mainstream. That's not the reaI deaI, right? Better beIieve it, oId son. Mainstream. Gee whiz. But Kevin is on to them. Let us make no mistake. Let it be understood. Our Kevin is on to them. Science, science... Have no fear about Kevin. Kevin is one smart cookie. No fIies on our Kevin. Reporting for duty. Yes... What? Don't forget about the probIem, Ray. ProbIem? He has to stay awake. Right. He has to stay awake. That's his probIem. - Felix! - Dinner's ready. Once you faII asIeep, they get you! - Parasites. - Run, critters! That's it, shazam, pop goes the weaseI. - What? - Pop goes the weaseI. It aImost happens to our Kevin. Yeah, he's gotta stay awake. You wanna know why? Because they are mainstream, baby! You've aIready done that bit. - What? - You've aIready done that bit. WeII, I'm doing it again, okay? - Okay. - Okay?! If you're so smart, Boo Boo, why don't you teII them? WeII, no, you teII them. You teII it much better than I do. It's so hot in here. It's Iike a goddamn furnace. The air conditioning is broken, baby. - What! - She said the air conditioner is broken. Why don't you go in there? It's cooIer. Give us a break, for pete's sake. You were teIIing us why Kevin has to stay awake. Ever since he was an itsy-bitsy IittIe snot-nosed kid, our Kevin had bought the whoIe stupid fairy taIe, hook, Iine, sinker, and the grand piano, you know what I mean? HeIIo? SuddenIy he became a grassroots goody two-shoes, a nobIe champion of non-profit advocacy organizations, etc., etc. And why? Because it made him feeI kind of cozy and mushy inside. You know the feeIing. But sadIy, Kevin, our hero, had these core issues to deaI with. You've aII heard about core issues? Sure you have. Kevin had tons of these things aII buzzing around inside him, because secretIy he knew the truth. He'd sort of cottoned on to the big, fat HuckIeberry Finn Iie that runs our worId and as a resuIt, he became bipoIar, had probIems with rage and so on and so forth. Poor schmuck couIdn't reIate. And that's awfuI. Poor schmuck probabIy shouId've married Dana Wynter. - Yeah, right. - Know what I mean? Dana couId've got him through his stuff, you know, got him to cIean up his side of the street, you know? Hello? She aIso had her own stuff that kept coming up. What time is it? Let's make no mistake about that. Let it be understood! - Hey...that's my Iine. - So? You stomped aII over my train of thought, you stupid son of a bitch. You stomped aII over my keynote speech. This is supposed to be my stupid keynote speech! - I'II kiII you! - I'm sorry. - Jesus Christ! - What does he want from us? - It's Bette? - What do I want from you? - Her name's Gina. - How does he know our names? - You write this shit, dude? - I'm bipoIar. Oh, I'm bipoIar. Are you bipoIar? I'm bipoIar. I'm a schmuck. I'm a schmuck, and I'm bipoIar. - He was a-- - I'm Boo Boo. I'm bipoIar. He's aIso co-dependent. I'm Boo Boo. I'm the bipoIar bear. - Very funny. - I'm the bipoIar bear! - AduIt chiId of aIcohoIics. - Stop this! - Stop doing this! - WouId you shut the fuck up! CooI it! - This is boring. - I'm hungry. Hey, Matt, Matt, are you okay? What do I say next? ''It's quite simpIe, reaIIy.'' I know that. What comes next? - Cut, cut. - Cut. Let's cut. Burt, come on, wake up! Matt, you're kiIIing us. Okay, back to first positions, everyone. Burt! - Put on the air conditioning! - What do I say next? Boo Boo! I'm Boo Boo. - Going down. - Wait for the camera, foIks. - Matt. Matt just went down. - What's going on? - ShouIdn't you get the-- - I have no idea-- He went down, huh? I'm hungry. Jesus, now what? He's nuts. Matt? Grab his arms. Actors. ReaI nice! Watch his head! Oh, I can't feeI my face! Let's Ioosen his shirt. Breathe! - Let's break for Iunch. - Give him air. Break for Iunch, everyone! One hour, everyone. You! You want my part. I don't want your part. Want some water? I don't want any water! - Let him breathe. - You don't have to have water. - Can we get Monica in here, pIease? - Who's Monica? - The production nurse. - She's never here when you need her. - I'II get her. - Try craft service. She's usuaIIy there. - AII right. - Thanks, Bonnie. - I need an ice pack. - Come on. - Does it stiII hurt? - Yeah. Shit, it stiII hurts. Abby, I need you to get me an ice pack for Gavin. - I just gotta figure out where-- - Give him to me. You can't work Iike this anymore. You're driving everybody crazy. - I know that. - Come here. Come here, MichaeI. My good IittIe-- How are you, sweetie? Jennifer, can you caII Marcia, the baby's mom, and teII her that she needs to come down here ASAP? - Right this second. - WeII, where is she? ProbabIy at the moteI sunning her ass. Go! Okay, caIm down. I am caIm! You're puIIing my chest hairs! Listen to me! You are the Ieader. I need you to act Iike one.

You're a baby! Very touchy, isn't he? Gavin, go down to the production trailer. Whoopsy daisy. Drop dead, Lars. I Iove you too! Evan. Evan, darIing-- - It's Gavin! - Sorry, sweetie. Listen, Evan, what are we going to do about this wig? - I mean, it doesn't even match-- - I don't care! - What! - PIease excuse me for breathing! Gavin, I'm reaIIy sorry that I came in on that Iine, but I don't know what's going on around here. - Who does? - What Iine? ''Stop it! Stop doing this!'' I thought Mort was gonna do that Iine. No, that changed Iast night. - WeII, I didn't know! - WeII, you shouId've! You shouId've said something! - Come on, FIorence NightingaIe. - Stop caIIing me that! The nurse is coming over now, and you were right, Barbara, she was over there at craft service just stuffing her face. UnbeIievabIe. Hey, what are you doing? Looking at your continuity sheets, if that's what these are supposed to be. You're such an asshoIe, Lars! I don't Iook through your shit. How's MarIon doing out there, anyway? - ShouId we get a doctor, too? - I'm gonna taIk to Burt about it. Honey, oh! Honey, come here. - How do you feeI? - Get him a chair. Get him in the chair. There we go. Back it in, back it in. I've done this before Iike this. D�j� vu. ShouId we start the scene in the kitchen? We finished it, man. We just have a pick-up shot. - We started the scene? - Yeah. You were terrific. No, no, I didn't think you'd started the scene yet. You scared the shit out of me. Hey, hey! If you ever touch me that way again, I wiII eat your heart for Iunch! What are you taIking about?! Don't you touch me! Don't anyone touch me! That's Iunch, everyone! One hour. One hour!

Yeah, I have a wife and a chiId. - He means Matt. - Matt? You know, the deceased? What's his name, Dobbs? Does he have a famiIy? Yes, he does. He has a wife and two young kids. I think they're divorced. - His kids are divorced? - What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you Iaugh at everything? I mean, a man has died. She thinks this is funny. - Are aII you movie peopIe Iike this? - Go, go! Who's in charge of things? I'm the director. - You've gotta be kidding. - He is, doc. He's in charge. We can aII vouch for that. - Who the heII was that? - That was the production asshoIe. I thought as much. Is there a producer around here? WeII, no. He's in LA. His name is Harvey Brickman. I'm gonna have to taIk to him. You know what, I'm gonna caII Harvey and break the news. - I'II wait for the ambuIance. - I'II go with you. No, it's okay. Go to Iunch. Copy that. Gavin! Your ice pack. Why has he got that ice pack on his knee? He had an accident surfing over in MaIibu. He surfs? Oh, yeah. - Harvey Brickman's office. - Harvey. - He's not here. - Where is he? - Would you like me to try his cell? - Put me through! God! He's on medication, isn't he? He's on everything. Thought as much. Vicodin? Yeah. Yeah, you got it. That's why he's wacko. He's wacko? HeIIo. Hey, Harvey, it's Gavin. - Marvin? - Gavin. - Gavin? - That's right.

Yeah, out here in the desert. - Garvin? - Gavin, not Garvin. - Right, no, I'm directing-- - Hot? - It's very hot out here. - Where? - Near Vegas. - Vegas? Listen, Harvey, we have a probIem. ActuaIIy, we have a very big probIem. One of your actors, Matt Dobbs, weII, he coIIapsed about an hour ago-- Who's he? PIaying-- WeII, he's dead. What do you mean? He can't die. We're in the middIe of a movie. Nobody dies untiI I teII 'em to die. - lt could've been a heart-- - Heart attack! Hiya, Francis! How you doing? You. CaII me. We'II have dinner. Or heat exhaustion. What do you mean, heat exhaustion?! We're already three weeks in. What do you want me to do, recast? You're breaking up, Harvey. You'd break up if you had my probIems. We can't recast. Jeez, what's the matter with you? John! John, take this away. It's rubbish! - What should l do? - How the heII shouId I know? You're the director! Do a rewrite! Everybody wants to be a writer these days. - What should l do! - I don't know. Get somebody from catering to do it, maybe transpo, just get on with it. - Get on with what? - What? Nothing, nothing, nothing. CouId you come up here? We've got no Iine producer or anything. Shut it down. Okay, I'II shut down production this afternoon. Great. You have my ceII phone number. ActuaIIy, production has my ceII phone. Or you couId caII my hoteI in Vegas. Well, it's not really in Vegas. lt's actually a motel--hello? HeIIo, Harvey? Hey, Gav, catch! Where the heII am I? - Matt Dobbs just died. - Who's he? He's an actor. He was your bright idea, wasn't he? What do I know? I'm just the writer. You'd better get up there to the desert and do a rewrite before some other idiot gets hoId of it. Very nice to meet you. So unprofessionaI. Hey, Gav! - Okay, this is the situation. - Evan, darIing. This is what the deaI is. We're shutting down production. - Harvey is coming up on Monday. - That shouId be Iots of fun. And what are we supposed to do, Superman, sit around and wait? I'm not sure what the IegaI deaI is in this case. - WiII you recast? - Don't even say that word. - Harvey wants to do a rewrite. - You're bringing the writer up here? - Yes, we're gonna do a rewrite. - I'm down with that. Oh, you wouId say that, Jeffrey. You're so nice. - So nice! - We need a rewrite. I have no idea what I'm doing in this thing. You need to bring the reaI writer up here. - Yes, the reaI writer. - Do we get paid? Yeah, weII, speak to your agent. CaII your agent. You don't understand, man. I have to be paid. I need the money. WeII, what's that thing caIIed, force-- Force major. He knows that. He knows everything. Bette, here's an idea. Why don't you have a drink? I gotta be paid. I'm gonna get a deputy on the set! Oh, babycakes, you're gonna get paid. Don't worry your IittIe head. Mommy'II Iook after that. Mommy'II Iook after that. Bette, wiII you go fuck yourseIf? You too, darIing. And that girIy horse you rode into town on... Why don't you just drop dead? I've enough of this shit! I'm gonna get a Iawyer. I think it's a pretty heaIthy group. What about you? I'II sue their ass. Burt, can we see daiIies tonight? I don't know, Gav. The projector's broken. - Like everything eIse on this movie. - Any other questions? - Yeah, I got a question. - Yeah, Lars? Who wrote this piece of crap? You guys figure it out. Yeah, baby! My God, this pIace must be a miIIion years oId. WiII that be it, sweetie? I think this gentIeman's next. No, sir. You're next. Thank you. That'II be $1 .35. What? $1 .35. - That's aII? - Did you want to pay more? No, it's just so cheap. That's the way it is out here, sweetie, free and easy. Yes, sirree, home on the range where the buffaIo roam. The deer and the anteIope pIay. DoIIy's LittIe Diner. Home from home. Home from home. What's your name? DoIIy Parton LookaIike.

Yeah, why not? Okay, you stand guard. Yeah. What? Stand guard. - No peeking! - Okay. Hello. Who's that man you were taIking to back there? I don't know. He said he thought he knew me from somepIace. He was kind of cute. That's better. Whose car is this? I don't know. Does it smeII kind of funny? Yeah. Ready? - Yeah. - Good. Let's go. Have a nice day. HeIIo, my friend. We meet again. CouId you possibIy give me a ride to Las Vegas? I fear that my car is about to expire. I seem to be Iost. I don't know if this goes to Las Vegas. Oh, it does. Take my word for it, yes sir. You're doing the right thing, just a IittIe off-track, but I can get us there. Good, then get in. To the Iand of BabyIon and fair fortune. I Iove the desert. You came into that diner this afternoon, right? Way down there on the highway. We spoke briefIy. Where's your girIfriend? She's in the back. She's sIeeping. Does she aIways sIeep with her eyes open? I never noticed. She's not my girIfriend. Oh, I apoIogize. ''Not having seen the dawn, I open every door.'' - You're Kevin McCarthy, aren't you? - That's what they teII me. I saw you in a great movie once. It was caIIed The lnvasion of the Body Snatchers. Was I in that? Yeah, and Dana Wynter. She was your girIfriend, and she was so beautifuI. Indeed she was. - You were the hero. - I was? Yeah. How do you Iike that! Why doesn't he Iisten to you-- what's his name? - Gavin. - Right, Garvin. I can never remember his name. Morty! Morty! Yeah, where you been, Morty baby, yeah? Yeah, I saw Francis yesterday. He Iooks terrific. You can't taIk? You with Bobby? And Leo! What, you having an orgy? I got you! I got you, you bastard! You caII me, now! CaII me! AII right, don't forget. I Iove you more. So why doesn't he Iisten to you? I tend to rattIe his cage. He doesn't Iike it. So was it Iike this before the actor-- what was his name--died? - Matt Dobbs. - What was going on then? Anarchy. Dobbs was rewriting the script. He'd caII script conferences every morning before shooting. It made everyone crazy. I thought we had a script! What was the probIem? He's an actor, what can I teII you. He wasn't even good at it. He was the ''Iook at me scratch my baIIs'' schooI of acting. They're aII such asshoIes. I asked this guy, Matt Dobbs, I asked him Iast week, - I said, ''Why are you doing this?'' - What'd he say? He said it was a generationaI thing. - What's that mean? - Beats the heII outta me. LittIe puke. Come on! You couIdn't do anything to stop it? What couId I do? Gavin had no controI. He was terrified. CouIdn't make decisions about anything, even about breakfast. I couId've heIped him, you know? Camera set-ups, Iots of-- but he wouIdn't Iisten. That's too bad. Dino! Dino, is that you, Dino? Dino! How you doing? You doing Hannibal 4: Blue Dragon with Hopkins? He's in or out? He wants more money? Fuck him. It's sad. He's a nice IittIe guy with a big heart. - What's his name? - Gavin. I think he's trying to prove himseIf somehow. Yeah, with big brother Mikey. Some hot shit producer, richer than God, with three big awards stuck up his ass. This poor schmuck's been trying to get even aII his Iife. Let's have Iunch. Enough with this garbage. Why do peopIe pIay this game? It is so boring! It eases tension. WeII, I'd rather enjoy my tension. It gets things done! When does Bonhoeffer get here? - I thought he was here! - Maybe he is. I never know what the heII that guy's taIking about with his stupid accent. What is he, IceIandic? No, he's WeIsh. Why do I aIways end up with the space cadets? - Where you shooting tomorrow? - Lucky Dice MoteI. Let's start kicking some ass, man! Where's the director?! Let's get on with it! Cut, cut, cut! - Cut! - That was cut. Hey, Harvey! It's--weII--I didn't know you were-- Today's Monday, isn't it? I'm sorry, but you got in the shot. What shot? What are you taIking about! The shot where Bette and Gina Ieave the moteI and go back to LA. Script check. Script check! There's no such scene! I'm in Room 419. You think that I was born yesterday? Shut up! - Harvey-- - It's Mr. Brickman to you, you IittIe putz! What's that thing around your neck? It's my baby boy, actuaIIy, Mr. Brickman. His name is MichaeI Joshua-- I don't wanna know his name! What's he doing around your neck? You try to direct my movie with a baby around your neck? But my wife is suffering from post-partum-- - Post-what?! - She can't cope. It's post-partum depression, Mr. Brickman. It's Iike Brooke ShieIds. - Your brother was right! - Brother? Yes, your big brother, the producer. He said you're a Ioser, an idiot. He's right! You bet your sweet ass I'm right, Harvey! Mikey! Stop the car! Stop the car! I mean, you asked me to do a rewrite-- Harvey! Harvey! Ask the schmuck about his knee surgery! - What? - I had this knee surgery and that why I have this titanium pIate-- WeII, here's the darn card that has the x-ray photo of it. It has my IittIe-- this one gets me through cIearances and concerts of course, and-- Why are you doing this to me? - I Iost my way. - Wake up. Hello, Felix. Are you ready, Iove? Let's go have some breakfast. - Hi. - Bonhoeffer, is that your name? - Yeah. - Are you aII right? Yeah. What are you Iooking at? Nothing. Where'd you get that hat? You got this for me Iast year in Texas. Don't you remember? Oh, yeah. Are you aII right, Iove? Yeah, I'm fine. Just a IittIe tired, that's aII. Aren't you gonna be hot in this jacket? No, I'm aII right. I Iike being hot. Can we sit anywhere? - Anywhere you pIease, honey chiId. - Thank you. There he goes again. Can we sit anywhere? - Anywhere you pIease, honey chiId. - Thank you. Be with you in a moment. WouId you both Iike coffee? Latte, extra hot, no foam, pIease. Mr. Bonhoeffer? I'd Iike an orange juice. - Mr. Bonhoeffer? - Yeah. Lars Munsen. Cinematographer extraordinaire. Oh, hi. You know my wife, Gina. Gina's been our moraI support in these troubIed times. Oh, Lars. She's our Iucky mascot. Isn't that right, IittIe one? TotaIIy amazing. There you have it. TotaIIy phantasmagoricaIIy amazing. Thank you, Lars. I shouId have introduced you. This young beauty's gonna be a movie star. She's my prot�g�. Her name's LiIy. She's from Russia. - Hi, LiIy. - Hi-Io. So, how is everything? Fantasia, oId man. - Lunacy. - That bad, huh? A Iooking gIass worId. Mad Hatter's tea party. Yeah? One orange juice. - Latte, no foam, sweetie pie. - Thank you. It's my pIeasure. - Who the heII was that? - The waiter? That's Aaron. So, what's the Iatest deveIopment? You are, Mr. Bonhoeffer. - I am? - Of course. HurtIing up here from tired oId TinseItown to rewrite our IittIe saga. Maybe you can write me a part, Mr. Bonhoeffer. - Me too. - WeII, I'II give it a go. Oh, yes, pIease. Harvey's coming up this afternoon, I beIieve. He's here. FIew in this morning. I doubt he'II heIp matters much. Harvey experiences road rage even in the bathroom. Heads wiII tumbIe, Iimbs wiII snap asunder, and many a tear wiII faII, I have no doubt. Hi-ho, and merriIy we go. Godspeed. Don't forget, now. See you guys Iater. Done with the paper? It's yours, oId chum, aII yours. Thanks. Bye. So that's Lars Munsen, huh? Lars and LiIy. What do you know. God, it's hot. This is where it aII started. It's Bette, honey, your oId friend, Bette Lustig. Bette, I've been Iooking for you everywhere. I had something to teII you. I know, honey. Gina toId me you were Iooking for me. Gina? I can't remember what it was I had to teII you. Look! Gina said you had a spot of troubIe, too. Remember? We drove up here three days ago. We're heading back to LA tomorrow. You wanna come with us? That's 45 minutes! Felix... Are you okay, honey? Don't think so. Let's go and say heIIo to Gina. - Gina, yeah. - You remember Gina, my niece. I think so. Of course you do. Are you in pain, honey? No, not anymore. - Gina. - HeIIo. You remember FeIix. Of course I do. - HeIIo. - HeIIo, Gina. WouId you Iike to join us for tea or coffee? - No, I can't. - No? Why not, honey? You Iook paIe. You have breakfast? I can't remember. Can't remember. - What's going on around here? - What do you mean? Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Don't do that, pIease. - Why not? - 'Cause it hurts me. You shouIdn't pIay with the big boys. - Right, Gina? - Word from the wise. - You're next. - You shouId get a IittIe rest. Yes, try to rest. - Remember?. - I just feeI so coId. I feeI so coId. Godspeed. They're making a movie around here somewhere. So I've heard. I tried to get a part in it, but with my reputation... I hear my friend Tracy pIays a very important part in it. Isn't that right, FeIix? A very important part. Isn't that right, FeIix? - HeIIo, FeIix. - Very important. WiII you have tea with us? l love the desert. lsn't it beautiful? l love the desert. Don't Iook at the camera, FeIix. Just be reaI. Like John Ford said to Ben Johnson, ''Just be reaI.'' Isn't that right, Mr. Brickman? Beats the shit out of me. That is such a crock. Are we in a movie? Everything's a movie. TaIking pictures. - That's aII it is. - TaIking pictures. Cheesy dreams... whiIe HuckIeberry Finn goes fishing on the edge of the moon. Who's Ben Johnson? He was in The Last Picture Show. Just Iike us. - Don't move, my Iove. Be stiII. - Be reaI. He's gone. You know, when my IittIe Ruthie died, I'd Iook into that mirror and I'd say, ''Bette, honey, this is it, girI. The show's on the road, and you've got to get up and get at 'em.'' - It's so sad. - Oh, I don't know. Something-- insurance or credit fraud, something Iike that, honey. - How fast will your car go? - ln honest miles-an-hour... I have to go now. I'II see you tomorrow morning at 7:00. Okay. Thank you, dear. Are you sure you don't need me to heIp you pack? No. What are you Iooking for? Are you okay? - Yeah. - You take care of yourseIf. Take care. Okay. See you. I just... need to find my... money. What a moron! It's not too hot for you, is it, Iady? Oh, it is a bit. But it sure is beautifuI out here. Pretty warm. I got us some candy bars. Hi. How you doing? Nuts, potato chips. Oh, good. That's great. - Have a nice day, sir. - Thank you. Something bothering you, mister? No, something bothering you? Yes. I don't Iike being watched or stared at, for that matter. Detective Buzz Larabee. I need you to identify a body. So... how weII'd you know him? I worked part-time at his bar, the CheIsea. And when did you see him Iast? Tuesday night. - This was at the bar? - Yes. So, what did you taIk about? We didn't taIk much. When I got off work that night, Mort escorted me to my car in the parking Iot. He was Iike that--poIite, aIways Iooking out for me. He toId me to take care and... gave me a few days off to bring my aunt up here to Vegas. - Anything eIse? - Yes. A man caIIed Bonhoeffer. Freaky, the whoIe day had been Iike that. How? I'd seen this man earIier on TV, FeIix Bonhoeffer-- - Who? - FeIix Bonhoeffer. That's what he caIIed himseIf. - I don't think it was his reaI name. - Why not? He was invoIved in a shootout. Now, invoIved in a shootout? What do you mean? He was with my friend Tracy in his car when it happened. WeII, what's this got to do with Mort? Who? The guy on the sIab, Iady, your friend in the freezer. Are you okay? No. Can I sit down? Let me get you some water. TiddIes! Hi, SheIIey. Where's the kitchen? I gotta get this Iady some water. It's through there. Are these two okay? - They're channeIing. - AII right. There you go. Thanks. What happened next? He caImed down after a few minutes, so Mort asked if it was okay to Ieave us together. You know, was it safe. He said he had to go. Okay. Then what? He got into his car and started to drive out of the parking Iot. ''...he started to...'' He got into his car and started to drive... ''...of the parking Iot... and then...'' Dinner's ready. Dinner's ready. Okay. I'II be there in a moment. How's it going? I don't know. It's a... IittIe strange. Like you. Hi, Stormy. Hello. Do you want to read what I've just written? No. Later, Iove. Come on, dinner's ready. - Come on. - I wiII, I'II be there. That was nice, thank you. Eat your saIad, it's good for you. It's organic. I hate saIad. - Bunny food. - The actor died. You know, he was falling all over the place, he was perspiring, and l don't know, his gun fell from his hand... And then the next thing, he collapsed. He collapsed, and so that was-- l don't know, that was it. You know, the actor died. We were left high and dry, literally. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. But the spooky thing was... What? Well, l don't know how to describe it. lt's like... it's like we have no control over anything. lt's like we're being pushed about by something. Everybody on the set felt it. lt was like a big joke. Ajoke? - Yeah, a joke. - lt was really strange. - How? - Well, the guy who wrote it... - He did it for a laugh. - That's what we heard, anyway. Who wrote it, Gavin? - l don't know. - Nobody knows, really. Nobody knows who he is or where he came from. lt's kinda scary. How do you mean, scary? Like when you're a IittIe kid... and it's dark... you keep thinking that you see somebody you don't know Iooking at you through a window. It's kinda Iike a dream. Oh, shit! Can't you controI your pages?! Oh, my God. Where the hell is he? Felix! Hey, Felix! Felix! So? What? What happens next, man? Search me. I don't have a cIue. You schmuck. Schmucko! You taIking to me? Who in the hell do you think l'm talking to? Leave me aIone. Give me a break, wiII you? You just killed Barbara. - Who? - My script supervisor, dummy! - So what? - She's the one person who's been holding this thing together. There's a lot of people with their dicks flapping in the breeze, and they're pissed off at you, man! What--what--what's-- what's going on around here? l don't know this place. l don't know this place. Garvin, baby! - Where am l? - We're inside Bonhoeffer's computer. Like viruses. What are you talking about? We're inside his hard drive, man. Think about it. You are nuts. Okay, so l'm nuts, but look in the corner. Do you see? That's Felix sleeping in that chair. - Who's Felix? - He's the writer. l eat writers for breakfast. Listen, l can't talk right now. l'm in somebody's hard drive. Did somebody say Felix Bonhoeffer?. - Well, who the hell are you? - Buzz Larabee, detective. l've gotta question this Bonhoeffer guy, whoever he is, and what do you two know about him, anyway? He's a writer. What's there to know? He was involved in a shootout on the freeway. - A shootout? - A shootout. l knew it! l knew it! l knew it! Yeah, l knew there was something about that guy with the stupid accent. Where can l find him? Look in there, over there to the left. See him sleeping in the chair?. That's him. There he is. So that's him. How can l get to him? - No, don't disturb him. - Why the hell not? - Because he owes me, that's why. - What do you mean? A conclusion. He keeps killing people off. Tell me about it, huh? Especially when he's tired. He needs to sleep. He's extremely dangerous, especially when he's tired. That's why l have to lock this creep up--he's dangerous. l hate writers. l always have. Did he write this garbage? WouId you mind taking out the garbage? - Who's that? - Who is that? - His wife. - Wife? His wife. l know that voice. Love, the garbage? Gina, don't wake him, Gina. Gina, please don't wake him. Love? Love, can you pIease take out the trash? What? Sorry. Can you pIease take out the kitchen trash before you go to sIeep? I don't want it to smeII up the house. Okay. Hi, Stormy. - Come on, Iove. - AII right. God AImighty. Why'd you kiII me off Iike that? What? Why'd you kiII me off Iike that? I didn't kiII you off. What are you taIking about? Shit, man, you kiIIed me in scene 23. I got the script right here. Keep your voice down. There, see? I was supposed to go to scene 32. You were? Yeah, man, my part was a Iot bigger than this. I had three more scenes. Oh, I don't remember that. Look at scene 32. That was supposed to be me. I was supposed to come in and yeII-- Stop doing this! So they didn't shoot it the way I wrote it? Man, Matt Dobbs was rewriting everything. He was aII over the pIace-- aII over the director, everyone. - Who was the director? - Gavin. Gavin, yeah, I remember. He was very good. He was a pussy on this thing. Nice guy, but he had no controI. Matt Dobbs was directing the fucking movie. He was? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that, Mort. My name's not Mort, it's PhiI. PhiI Henderson? PhiI, I'm sorry, PhiI. I didn't-- So, who's Mort? Mort is the character I was pIaying, man. What's wrong with you? Oh, the hoIe in the head. So, this guy was directing everything? Everything, man. He had us doing Iine readings. He kept saying he knew Pacino and Scorsese. Big fucking deaI. He kept saying things Iike, ''I was out Iast night, and I was taIking to Bobby, - ''and MarIon was there...'' - Hey, Leo! ''...and MarIon said this, and Bobby said that, and AI, you know he Ioved improv.'' - AII that crap. - Actors. Maybe that's why the jerk-off died. He had to have totaI controI, you know what I mean? A power freak. Even Gavin went nuts at one point. You remember that speech about The lnvasion of the Body Snatchers? Body snatchers? No. - You didn't write that? - No, I didn't write it. I knew it. I knew it. This guy was a piece of work. He just took off on this speech about body snatchers in a movie. Don't you see the daiIies? No, I'm not aIIowed near the set, that's why. WeII, you wrote the movie, and it was a good script. It was very good. In fact, that's the onIy reason I took the movie. It was a big break for me. So, someone died? Yeah, Matt Dobbs. You wrote the part of Ray for an African-American, right? I did? Yeah, man, what's wrong with you? Are you on drugs? No, no, I'm not on drugs. Ray, the character that Matt Dobbs was pIaying, was bIack. Matt Dobbs wasn't a bIack actor, man, he was white, Iike her. Oh, my God. Why did you kiII me off, FeIix? - Barbara. - I was just the script supervisor. That's aII I was. It's Barbara. Now you have no continuity. Nothing makes sense anymore. It's so unfair. It's just so unfair. So unfair. Go. Mommy. Oh, my God. Let's get a doctor, an ambuIance. Oh, God. It's okay, man. It's okay. Yeah, they gave him a thorough checkup. BIoodwork was fine, and the heart is great. They even gave him a brain scan, but he's fine. What happened was I went into the den... Love, can you take out the trash before you Iock up, pIease? The kitchen trash. Love, can you pIease take out the trash before you Iock up? Are you okay? I can't move. I couIdn't wake him up. He said he couIdn't move, so I just caIIed the ambuIance, and we got him to the hospitaI. I guess he's just stressed out. He's been working so Iate on this project of his, but he's fine. I'II see you at the hospitaI. No escape. We got him to emergency, but couldn't find anything wrong with him. He's right as rain. Terrible pain. So, when they gonna let you go, honey? Maybe Tuesday. Maybe not today, maybe tomorrow. Life. Hi, Felix. Felix. Hi. I'm Dr. Geekman, and this is my associate, Dr. Stuart Cohen. So, you're ready to go home? The good news is we can find nothing physicaIIy, organicaIIy wrong. - AbsoIuteIy nothing. - It couId be just stress, right, Stu? Right, stress, anxiety, perhaps. Has he been under stress?
