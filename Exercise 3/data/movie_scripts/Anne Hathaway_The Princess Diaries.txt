You can choose them in the arsenal. Guns, grenade, dagger... and wings. Let's see what wings can do. After each pass A new story of princess-d is revealed. You get to know more about her world, her history. For her future, you have to work it out with her. Why princess-d? You don't like it? You may change it if you want. Princess Diana is a dream.

I saw you dancing with the lady yesterday. Anna? Right, Anna. Feels like you were dancing with Mom again. She is smart. Pick up real quick. But not as good as your Mommy. I think she was dancing with feelings. Really? You felt it? Didn't you feel it? I felt... something... But not so clear. What's not clear? Was she just dancing, or was she... What exactly was it? Try to feel it exactly. Go out dancing with her, or join dance competitions. How about you? Are you clear? It seems like you have feelings for princess-d too. Now, what exactly you want? I want to borrow money. How much? A hundred thousands. Too much? Whatever you can. Are you sure of it? If not, I won't lend you. Yes! I'm sure! Good! A man should be sure of himself.

Look, what a mess! Thank you! Bye I never know that Hong Kong could be so tranquil at night. The street could be so wide. I don't believe we can be together So even I can imagine it Imagine me being a real princess. I have given no thought to tomorrow. But at this moment I am sure I could fly. Good luck to me. Ling, wake him up if you want. No, it's fine. Please tell Joker that I'll be busy these few days and I won't be able to come. I have to go. Anything I can help? Teach me how to dance next time. Mom Sam, Ling is in trouble. Let me have a look. Real quick. Pick up! Hello! Shit! Mom, did Sis call back? Tell her not to pass the border! Don't pass! Miss... Stop... Miss! Come in for check. Your phone's ringing. Leave it? Quick Open it. Even Even Even What are these? Odd! OK. Pack up. You can go. Thank you. Hello? Sis, sis! Speedy's arrested. Don't go! Speedy's arrested. Don't go! You're there? Sam, behave. I know. Ling It has been tough on you. I'm sorry. Take a look around as you please. It looks different. Is it really here? Is it? It is. The owner renovated the whole place. It's a good apt. The ex-tenants moved because they emigrated. Where to? That I don't know. Let's go over there. I heard they made a fortune in business And stock market. Their kids are brilliant. All study abroad, Masters and Doctors. This place has good Fengshui. Care to look at the room? Be careful. Does princess-d have wings? Yes, she does. Where could she fly? Anywhere she wishes. Why don't people have wings? Where do you want to fly to? Anywhere I wish. Don't forget to come back. If I can't come back... Could you use computer to get me back? Could you? Come here. What? I have something for you. Come. This is for you. Not much. At least helps a little. When I make it, l... I've told you following me do you no good. Brother I don't get it. Why Ling has to go? In an abandoned city The only survivor is a girl controlled by monsters. She is the Princess of the lonely kingdom. A girl abandoned by the rest of the world. She chases her own shadow everyday. She speaks with the shadow, playing hide and seek. The shadow is her best friend. Following me do you no good! How she desires happiness Imagining another world, another person. But she hears only her own echoes. Until one day, one touch Hello! I bring you out. I bring you out... I bring you out. The real journey has just begun. In touch With princess-d Ling didn't become a princess The day when princess-d appeared, Ling disappeared unexpectedly. I know Joker should know why But he didn't want to tell me He only said there were things computer really couldn't handle. Maybe one day, I'll understand when I grow up. When will I grow up? Kid ... Yes? Here comes the journal of princess-d Really? The weather was not as nice as expected But still it feels comfortable. Maybe it is not the right time No much layering of colors to be seen But it is still a beautiful grassland Although no ferris wheel and merry-go-round But I can feel that this is the place you are looking for. I wish someday you could walk with me on the path. I believe the day will come I believe. Because I am sure of it. P.S. Kid... One thing we keep forgetting Make the videos for Dad.
