(CRICKETS CHIRPING) (GIRL SPEAKING KOREAN) (WOMAN SPEAKING KOREAN) (GIRL WHINING) Oh! (GASPS) (LASERS FIRING) (THUNDER CRACKLING) (WIND HOWLING) (SCREAMING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (KEYS JANGLING) (SIGHS) Um... I got into the car at 2:00. But then... I was coming here. Well, I thought I was coming here. But then Georgia wanted to go to the loft. So then... You know, she's my fare home, so then I had to go to the loft. (CLICKS TONGUE) And when we got there, she was like, "Well, now I want to take a nap." So... (CHUCKLES) Then I'm waiting for her to, like, wake up, and then I fell asleep. I have been asleep all night. (AWKWARD CHUCKLE) (SIGHS) Are you angry? Okay. How... How angry do you think I should be? Do you think I should be, you know, really angry? A little bit angry? What do you think would be appropriate right now? (SIGHS DEEPLY) What's a good response? Go on. A little angry. (CLATTERING) Can it be less angry? Mmm-hmm. We're not going to fight about this. Fine by me. Just not going to do it. Not going to do it. The same old things... Going over and over again. I get angry 'cause the only time I get to see you is when you're hungover, and you stay home all day and watch TV, and then you say being out of work this long is "affecting" you. And that isn't true? And I say you're doing nothing to change your situation, and you tell me you're going to prove me wrong, and then I catch you lying, lying again to me, to yourself, because you stay home all day, and it's just talking in circles. I'm just getting so tired of it! Tim... (CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS) Listen. Georgia wanted to go to the loft. I didn't even want to go. Who the fuck is Georgia? Natasha. (SIGHING) Gloria, you are... You're a mess. You are out of control, and I love you, but I cannot deal with you in that state. What are you talking about? So I've packed your things, they're in the bedroom. What? What? You can keep the cases. They're cheap ones. What? I think it would be best for both of us if you were not here when I got back. Okay? So, um... Tim! Goodbye. I'm sorry. Tim! Tim! (DOOR SLAMS) (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) Yeah, that's him. Thank God! WOMAN:...disgusting! What do you think you're gonna get out of that? Disgusting! I know! (CACKLING) Must have been... I don't know, he must have never done anything since she was, like, 12 years old. (GUFFAWING) Probably not. Hey, Gloria! Where's the plug? My phone is on red right now. Trying to order some Chinese food... Who wants an apple? No, I want Chinese food! This is way too, like, healthy! An apple, are you kidding me? No. (BACKGROUND CHATTER CONTINUES) (SIGHS) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (GROANS) (BRAKE SCREECHES) (GROANS) Excuse me. Oscar? Gloria. Gloria! Wow! (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, wow! Whoa. I can't believe it! Uh... Oh, my God, it's a miracle I recognized you! Well, yeah, I mean... Anyway! Hi. Yeah, hi! Hello. Hi! Wow! Uh, so, what are you doing here? Uh, um, I needed a vacation. And my parents hadn't rented out the house, and, you know, I haven't been up here in so long, so it's just like, you know... Sure. Yeah. Yeah. What are you doing now? Like, right now? Nothing. Wanna hang out? Yeah. Sure. Yeah, sure! Yeah, come on, here, hop in! Okay. Cool. Yeah. Uh... (GRUNTS) Okay. Do you need any help? (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (CHUCKLES) Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm still just totally blown away that you're actually here. (BOTH CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY) Yeah. Um, where are we going? Oh! Yeah! Uh, we're going to, uh, to work. Work at the, uh, at the bar. Oh, you work at the bar with your dad! That's nice. Uh, well, no, it's... It's mine now. Yeah. My, uh, dad passed away. Oh, I'm sorry, Oscar. I'm really sorry. It's all right. Oh, when did that happen? Uh, a few years ago. He was a really nice guy. Yeah. How's your mom? I bet that was really hard on her. Uh, well, she died long before that. Jesus. I'm so sorry. Yeah. You were still living here. Don't you remember? You went to the funeral. GLORIA: Huh. It looks different than I remember. OSCAR: Oh, well, yeah. No, I did some renovations a while back. Yeah, less and less people started showing up, and I think the whole country-western thing was scaring people away, honestly. Wow! Hey! I like it. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thought you would. It's more refined, right? Yeah, I just wanted something that had a little bit more of a classic-feeling bar. You know? Something that doesn't necessarily need to rely on a theme or anything like that. Well, it has a theme. No, it doesn't. No, I mean, it's got a vibe, yeah, for sure, but, I mean, it doesn't have a theme. No. What would the theme be? Like, a bar? Hey, didn't this used to be bigger? Yeah. Yeah. Good memory. Yeah. I just ended up shutting that half down. You know, we didn't need it, with the people and everything. But it's all right. Got a buddy that comes in every now and then that helps me out. Most of the time I can just fend for myself, though, so... You all right? Hmm? You're just... Oh! Yeah. (CHUCKLES) It's this nervous tic I have. I get this itch right here... You look like a monkey. Yeah. I look like a monkey. (BOTH CHUCKLING) So what? You're Oscar's secret... (MUSIC PLAYING VIA SPEAKERS) No. We don't know anything about you. We were, uh, friends in elementary school, and then I moved to New York, and I've lived there ever since. Now I'm just... I'm visiting for a few days. You know what your problem is? What's my problem? I used to live in New York, too, a while back. I worked there for a few months in a print shop. Then I met this guy who'd lost his passport and he couldn't afford a new one, so I decided to help him out, let him stay with me for a while. After a week of living with him, I find out the police are looking for him because he beat up his boyfriend. OSCAR: Hey, Garth? Sorry, what's my problem? What's your problem? Yeah, you asked me did I know what my problem was, and then you told a story, and I don't know what... What does it have to do with me? I didn't ask you that. Did I? Yeah, you did. Sorry. He has this problem that whenever he meets someone new, he gets very eager and starts babbling a lot. That is totally not true. Sorry. (CHUCKLES) (MUSIC FADES) So, what do you think of Mainhead? Has it changed a lot? To tell you the truth, I have no fucking idea. OSCAR: Right back here. Holy shit! Oscar, the horses! Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no. Oh, my God, you kept this part the way it was! It's awesome! Oscar, why don't you use it? It's so great! Well, I told you, I didn't really need it. GARTH: Didn't really need it? He ran out of money in the middle of the renovation. Couldn't afford to finish it. This is his dark little secret. Like a lower back tattoo. Hey! (GLORIA CHUCKLING) Oscar! OSCAR: Yeah. You're nuts. This place is magical. It's... Because it's not literal anymore! It's like... It's actually ironic now. Want a Tic Tac? Why, does my breath smell? GARTH: Hey, Oscar! OSCAR: Mmm-hmm. You got any teabags? OSCAR: Why, do you want a cup of tea? GARTH: No, I want a teabag. With the little string and the paper doohickey at the end... Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. What do you need it for? I'm gonna do a trick. I don't know your name. Uh, Joel. Gloria. (WHISPERS) Why do they always do that? What? They always introduce you to all the guys except for the good-looking ones. One. (OSCAR AND GARTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh, it's like a fucking Wes Anderson movie in here, Oscar, I love it! I wish the songs were better. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) When we were kids, back in school, every year they'd have this short story contest in the spring, and Gloria here would always win! (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Always! GLORIA: Oh, come on! My stories were terrible. Oh, yeah? Well... (GLORIA LAUGHS) Mmm, apparently they were better than mine, so... (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm gonna get more booze. I didn't know that you wanted to be a writer. You... (LAUGHS) No, I didn't. That... You missed the point, Dumdum. I'm not... She's the writer... I'm... I'm not a writer. I mean, I don't, like... I don't write fiction. I write articles for an online magazine. Oh, they're on the Internet! (SIGHING) Yeah, they are. Well, that's... That's cool! It is. Yeah. Write down the address, and then I could check it out. Oh... Okay. (CHUCKLING) Uh-huh... Yeah. There we go. (GASPS) (TOILET FLUSHES) Sorry. Hey! What the hell's wrong with you? Huh? Am I gonna have to kick your ass again? Oscar, nothing happened. Please. Spare me. Okay? It's your first night back in town, somebody had to go fuck it up... Easy. We've all been drinking, okay? It's fun. We're just having fun. Nothing happened. Nothing happened! Yeah... What's going on? Nothing! (CHUCKLES) (CLICKS TONGUE) (KEYS JANGLING) Jesus Christ. (WHISPERS) What happened? (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (CHILDREN LAUGHING, PLAYING) Shit. (SIGHS) (GRUNTING) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (GRUNTS) (SIGHING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WIND HOWLING) (THUNDER CRACKLING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh. (GROANING) Ow! (WHISPERS) What the... Hi. Oh, hey, sis, what's up? No, I'm okay. I'm just... I'm okay. Yeah. No, I haven't heard anything. What are you talking about? What? Oh, come on. I mean, that's gotta be like a... (STAMMERING) It sounds like an Internet prank or something, right? It's like a viral hoax? Right? What? Oh, my... Oh, my... Okay, you know, I need both my hands. I gotta call you back. Okay, bye. Oh, my God! (WHISPERS) Holy shit. Oh, my God. (GASPS) (CHATTER IN KOREAN) (GUNSHOT) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GASPS) (CRASHING) (GASPING) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) (RINGING TONE) TIM: Hello? Um, is this a good time to talk? I mean, are you... Are you busy? Yeah, I'm fine. Just got home. What's wrong? What's wrong? Oh, my God, Tim. I just looked at the news, and I... I think I'm in shock. I mean, a giant monster just materialized over Seoul. Out of nowhere! I mean... Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's crazy. But, Gloria, that happened, like, nine hours ago. You're just hearing about this? Yeah. Well, what have you been doing all day? I... Um... I've been, like, you know, doing stuff around the house. Hey, what are you... What are you getting at, Tim? I'm worried about you, that's all. You said you were going home to figure things out, to get your life together... (STUTTERING) That is exactly what I'm doing! Gloria, if you're still out drinking all night, you need professional help. You know, we've been here before, and... (GROANS) (SIGHING) (DISTANT SHOTS) NEWSCASTER:... whether this shocking phenomenon is considered an attack or a natural disaster. Meanwhile, the global state of emergency continues, with stock markets plunging. Thanks. So far, this is the best footage we have of the creature vanishing into thin air. The unprecedented nature of... Did you get that tingle? When you know you're watching something that's gonna change the course of history? Stephen Hawking has been the most outspoken among scientists in raising the question of whether we need to revise our entire understanding of the laws of physics. With hundreds of specialists already converging on Seoul, initial scientific analysis has raised concerns... OSCAR: All those innocent victims. And here we are, just thinking how lucky we are to be watching. ...this, and the high level of air contamination triggered by the destruction, have accelerated the evacuation of many affected urban areas. The UN has called for a worldwide ceasefire, and is asking for support from all nations able to help. The US and NATO forces have already been dispatched to help with search and rescue operations, as the number of injured or missing citizens continues to climb. After the first public statement from the South Korean president... (REPORTER CONTINUES IN DISTINCTLY) (SIGHS, SNIFFLES) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (GLORIA MOANS) Uh... (SIGHS) (RINGING TONE) TIM: Hello? Hi. Did I wake you up? No. It's okay. What's up? I just want to talk to you. I just woke up, and, um, I thought you'd be on your way to work, so I wanted to talk to you. Gloria, Gloria, you're drunk. I'm not talking to you when you're drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm talking to you. I've been, uh, getting stuff for the house. I bought, uh... I bought an inflatable mattress. I've got to get ready for work, okay? I'll talk to you later. Shit. Shit! (AIR PUMP WHIRRING LOUDLY) (AIR PUMP CONTINUES WHIRRING) (DOORBELL RINGING) (GRUNTING IN PAIN) Hi. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Hi. I brought you a TV. Careful. (GLORIA CLEARS THROAT) (AIR PUMP CONTINUES WHIRRING) Oh, shit. Uh, I just gotta... I mean, I think we should probably put it in here. Yeah. Sorry. Ugh... (WHIRRING STOPS) Um... Yeah, sorry, it's kind of, uh, a mess in here. This is, uh, the only place I can get Wi-Fi without a password, so... Um, what did you say? What... I didn't say anything. Oh, okay. Why don't we pop it over here? Got the outlet and everything. Okay. You want me to, uh, do anything, or... No! Honestly. I'm good. I know what I'm doing. I like doing this kind of stuff. Okay. Thank you. Oh, I gotta say, this is a... This is a pretty nice surprise. What, the TV? Yeah. We talked about this last night. Don't you remember? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yeah. Did the monster come back? Uh, yeah. It attacked Seoul again. What? But not as bad. You know, the thing appeared, the monster, in the, uh, same place, but it just stood there and, like, made a bunch of weird hand gestures. I dunno. But it did destroy a few buildings and some people got hurt, but, again, nothing like last time. What time did it happen? 8:05. The same... Exact same time. That's weird. Same time as yesterday, and same time as, you know, the other time it showed up. What other time? You... I'll show you. Yeah. Yeah... Yeah. Please. (EXHALES) Can't believe you haven't seen this. This is, uh... Yeah. It was, like, 25 years ago. Oh, my gosh! It appeared and disappeared, exact same... 8:05, right on the dot. Back then, everyone just thought it was a hoax. But, yeah, it's the only photo they have. Not the greatest quality, but, you know, you can tell... Whoa... it's it from the silhouette, right? Seoul, too? Uh, yeah, that was in Seoul, yeah. Well, that's a shame. Why do you say that? Well, you know, like... If the monster is only attacking Seoul, then all the rest of the world will stop caring, you know? Like all the ceasefires that happened, they... (GROANS) They'll just end. Hmm. So you don't remember anything we talked about last night, huh? (SIGHS) I got really melodramatic, didn't I? Well, uh, you told me that you weren't really on a vacation. That you've been looking for a job for a year, and you've been living with your boyfriend, Tim, and, uh, it didn't work out, and since you didn't have any money, you decided to move back here for a little while. For the record, I figured out that you were broke on my own, so you don't have to feel bad about... Oh, well. Congratulations. Is there anything else? I told you that if you wanted to give me a hand at the bar, you're more than welcome. You know, make a little money while you're staying here. What did I say? (CHUCKLES) You said yes. (SCOFFS) (LAUGHS) Yeah. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you when you were drunk. That's bad timing by me... No. What are you talking about? That's such a nice thing to do. Figured I'd offer, I'm sorry. But, I mean, do you need help at the bar? If this mess keeps going on, yeah, yeah, I'll definitely need help at the bar. People gotta drink. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll come to work at the bar if you agree that we clean up the western side. Mmm-hmm. All right, you're hired! Yes. Mmm-hmm. Country side is gonna open! Make it official. Boom. Thank you. Uh, start at 5:00? Tonight? Great. All right. Well, there we have it. Hey. Yeah. Uh... Thank you. Oh. Yeah. Of course. OSCAR: You need a sofa. Huh? What? You should get a sofa for in here, so you can watch, you know... Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Hang out. All right. You want me to pick you up later? That'd be great! Thank you. Cool. Can do. (DOOR OPENS) Thank you! OSCAR: Mmm-hmm. (DOOR CLOSES) Perfect. Okay. NEWSCASTER: The impact of the creature's appearance has been felt worldwide. Additionally, a large number of humanitarian forces are arriving in Seoul to help with rescue and recovery efforts. A coalition of religious members have lent their support and plan to visit affected areas. (COMPUTER KEYS CLACKING) (SIGHS) NEWSCASTER: Despite the lack of recent attacks, the city remains on high alert. As there seems to be no discernible pattern to the location of the monster's appearance or path of destruction, the entire city of Seoul and its surrounding suburbs are on high alert. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) GARTH: See, I don't think it's alive. What do you mean? I mean, it's not an animal. It's like a machine, and it's being operated by remote control or something. OSCAR: Mmm. Do you ever notice how it just keeps moving, destroying everything in its path, but it never looks down? If you were walking, surrounded by buildings up to your waist or your shoulder, wouldn't you look around to see where you were going? Even if you wanna destroy everything, it makes no sense to keep staring straight ahead if everything is below you. Hey. You okay? (SIGHING) (SIGHS) (PHONE ALARM BLARING) (KIDS YELLING) NEWSCASTER 2: This is the creature's third appearance. Surprisingly... (GASPS) ...there were no reported casualties or property damage, as the monster hasn't moved from the spot of its initial appearance... (GASPS) NEWSCASTER 1: Despite the confusion caused by the creature's last appearance, NATO, the UN and coalition forces remain on high alert. (SIGHS) In a statement... Ah! ...military forces will be ready to strike if the monster appears again. What the... What the... I don't understand... Come on... No, no... (GRUNTS) Come on! Ah! (INHALES SHARPLY) The inability of the government to evacuate its citizens quickly enough has forced the council to model the potential civilian casualties involved in moving forward with the operation. This move has caused a massive outcry from humanitarian organizations around the world. Okay. (WHISPERS) Okay. (MONITOR BEEPING) Hey. Hi! Fine. How are you doing? I just wanted to apologize for the other day. I was just, um... You know, my tone. I've just been lecturing you a lot, and I just haven't even really asked, you know, if you're okay. (STAMMERS) I'm fine. I'm not trying to pry or anything, I'm just, um... Don't really know what you're actually doing there. What I'm actually doing? I'm... It... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I'm, um, working. Working? Yeah. Yeah! I'm working in a bar. It belongs to a friend of mine from school, and, um, he hired me part-time, and I am a waitress. You're a waitress? Yeah. (DOORBELL RINGS) Um... But... Hold on. Gloria? Oscar. Brought the sofa. Hi! Hi! (JOEL GRUNTS) What? A sofa? Yeah. You wanted a sofa. I wanted a sofa? Uh, okay, so bring it through here. Yeah. I think it would be good in here. Um... Say we go against this wall here. Yeah, yeah, that'd be... Oh, my gosh. OSCAR: What? A futon! Yeah, is that okay? GLORIA: You remember my inflatable mattress? It has a hole in it or something. I don't know. It deflated. My back is killing me. Thank you! Oh, my gosh! Yeah. Oh! (OSCAR LAUGHING) That's so nice. It's good timing then, huh? Mmm-hmm. (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) I've never seen anyone so excited about a futon before. Highlight of my day. OSCAR: Well, sorry to break up the love affair here, but we gotta go to work. No. Yeah. Not yet, not yet! Yeah, it's time to work. Let's go. Okay. Hold on, I just gotta grab my phone. OSCAR: Do it! (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENS) That's amazing. I owe you big for that. (DOOR CLOSES) All right, so I want you to watch, because this is how Oscar dances when he is trying to seduce you. It was a wedding. Right, right. Okay? This is not my normal... Note the fingers gyrating around the entertainment center. (ALL LAUGHING) What are you doing? (PHONE VIBRATING) OSCAR: Hilarious. (GARTH CACKLING) JOEL: Hilariously accurate! (PHONE CONTINUES VIBRATING) So. The astronaut climbs into the capsule. Hey, Joel, just make sure to turn off the lights in here. Don't turn anything off and on out front, okay? JOEL: I got it! Just forget it. Nobody's even paying attention. Doesn't matter. What? OSCAR: Listening to what? To the story about the astronaut! Jesus Christ! Weren't you listening to a word I was saying? No! Who cares about the story? Are you gonna do the trick, or what? I'll do the trick at the end of the story about the astronaut. Why? (STAMMERS) If the trick's good enough, fuck the story. But what if the trick sucks? Fuck the story. (WHISPERS) All right. OSCAR: All right, just to catch you up, blah, blah, blah, there's an astronaut, et cetera. All right, here we go. Showtime. Don't blow it out. Patience... Not all that interesting. (GASPS) Oh! Look at that! Huh. (GARTH GASPS) Very cool. Very cool. I feel like it would have been better with the story, though. GARTH: Are you fucking kidding me? I need to tell you guys something. But you have to promise that you're not gonna tell anyone. Okay? Not a soul. All right? This is a secret between us. No one else can know, okay? All right. We gotta go to the park, and then I am gonna show you guys something. OSCAR: All right. Okay. Uh, there's a website called, um, "Seoul Under Attack: Live Feed," something like that. You gotta find that one, and, uh, everybody over there. Okay. Gloria, what is this? (SHUSHING) I just need everybody to be quiet. Just go. (SOFTLY) Okay. All right. Good, good, good. Everybody's gonna be over there, and I am... I'm gonna be on this side... All right, I got it. Now what? (SPITS) You... Joel. Come on! Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um... Uh, click on the window that has... It's the river area. The third one, I think? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, it's gonna happen really soon, so just wait for it. Wait for what? Just watch your screen and tell me when you see it. See what? (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Holy shit. All right. It's back. Do you see it? Yeah, I got it. Is it there? The giant monster? Yeah. (GLORIA CHUCKLING) (HELICOPTERS WHIRRING) GARTH: Holy shit! Gloria, you gotta see this! GLORIA: What is it doing? It's dancing. It's dancing, like... Holy shit. (GLORIA LAUGHING) GARTH: Uh, it stopped. Hi, assholes! Mwah! I'm blowing you kisses. I am blowing you kisses! GARTH: Whoa! JOEL: What the... GARTH: Okay. How? How? Wait. This isn't happening. No, no, no. This is not happening. This is one of those practical joke apps. This is a joke. But, you know, I still feel like dancing, so... Can you guess which film this is from, huh? The fuck is going on? (GLORIA LAUGHING) Do you wanna make any requests? This does not last that long. It's a joke. What... What the... (DISTANT EXPLOSION) Ow. (STAMMERS) They're shooting at you. Missiles. They're shooting at me? Are you serious? Who? Where? Where? All right. Come on, fuckers! You wanna mess with me? Come on! (GRUNTING) Ow! What was that? A helicopter crashed. Into my head? Yeah. With, like, the pilot and everything? (PEOPLE CLAMORING OVER THE SCREEN) Wow. OSCAR: All right, Gloria. What is this? Shit. Shit. I don't want to be here anymore. Um, I don't... How do I get out? Which way is the river? I don't know where it is... Hey! Gloria! I don't want to be here anymore, can you just show me... Holy shit! What? (GASPS) NEWSCASTER 2: (MUFFLED) This is the only footage of the attacks we have so far. It's unbelievable, I mean, look... (NEWSCASTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (SIGHS CONTENTEDLY) ...trying to understand what their lives have become. Trying to comprehend everything they've lost. (SIRENS, EXPLOSIONS) (HORRIFIED GASP) (DOOR CLOSES) Oh, you're up. I took your keys, 'cause I didn't want to wake you when I got back. Um, I hope that's okay. I... Also, I noticed you didn't have any food... How many people did I kill? Um... Give me the paper. Wait, no, hold on, hold on, hold on. Gloria, listen... Can you please tell me how many people died? How about I fix you something to eat, and then we can... We can just talk about it calmly, you know? Um... Not many. All right? (SOBBING) Fuck! What are you doing? "Not many"? How many does "not many" mean? Gloria. Okay, you gotta calm down. Does it mean 100 people? Does it mean 200 people? Gloria! What does "not many" mean? (PANICKING) I gotta tell someone. I gotta turn myself in. Hey! You gotta calm down. I gotta turn myself in... Wait, now, hold on! I gotta tell them what happened... Yeah, but you don't know what happened. (SOBBING) Yes, I do! Yes, I do! I killed a shitload of people because I was acting like a drunk idiot! Again! Hey! Gloria! Hey! Hey! That's not what happened! What? Well, not the only thing that happened. Pretty sure that's me. We can see streets littered with debris here after the attack. There appear to be several emergency response vehicles... They're so freaked out by the giant robot suddenly appearing that they're not talking about the dancing. Okay. Okay. Had you ever been in the park at 8:05 before? Mmm... I can't recall. I don't think so. You don't think so? You don't... Come on. Been in the park at that time in the morning? No. No, definitely not. So this could've happened at any time during all these years. Yeah. It's crazy that it only happens to the two of us. And the first time my monster appeared was when we were kids? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Excuse me? More coffee? No... No... I'm good. Thanks. Do you think she heard something? I think she heard something. Heard what? That we're the ones destroying Seoul? Shh! Shut up! Don't say that! Calm down! Even if she heard you, she'd have no idea what we're talking about, okay? I just... I think we need to keep it cool, be careful, okay? People are looking at us. (WHISPERING) People are looking at us! Hi. I'm the robot. She's the monster. (LAUGHING UNCOMFORTABLY) He's... (WHISPERING) I'm leaving! I'm leaving! Whoa! Hey! Stop. I'm sorry. Okay? Just calm down. Now, what were you saying? You were talking about the first time your monster showed up. Okay. What were we doing back then? Um, going to school. No. What were we doing at that exact time? We were going to school. Yeah. 8:05 is when we would be walking to the bus stop. That's right! Yeah, but I don't remember walking through that park... In fact, that wasn't even a park when we were kids. You know? Remember? It was that fenced-off area... It was a construction site. Yeah, with, like, garbage and trees... GLORIA: But it was, like, dirt, it wasn't... OSCAR: Mmm-hmm. GLORIA: Right! (THUNDER RUMBLING) Do you still wanna confess? No. I feel terrible, but I'm, you know... Not like confessing is gonna do any good. No, that's true. Actually, there's nothing we can do. There's nothing we can do. Yes, there is. (GRUNTS) Boom. Did he think it was weird? No. No, not at all. Nah, he's an old friend. I've been coming here for years. (SIGHS) Look, he even gave us free food. Nice, huh? (SIGHS) Okay. So, uh, where do you want to meet later? Oh! Uh... You know what, man, it's your night off. You should probably get some rest. I can do this. It's fine. Are you kidding me? I'm not gonna be able to sleep. (ENGINE STARTING) Me neither. GLORIA: I guess it was the wrong time to be funny. When I made a humorous allusion halfway through a sentence. Um, thought it was funny at the time, and, you know, it seemed harmless, because it was a play on words. A play on words is funny 'cause of how it sounds, not 'cause of what it means. They didn't fire me, but when they started downsizing, I was the first to go. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Oh, you jerk, you already knew. Yes. I'm sorry. Ugh. Why didn't you tell me? Why are you letting me, like... (IMITATES RETCHING) Why? I don't... ...my past? I didn't want you to think I was creepy, like I'm some sort of stalker... Well, it's too late for that. You know? (CHUCKLING) Yeah. So you've been following me all these years? Of course I have. Somebody actually made it out of here and did something special for once. You know, this place is not bad at all. You've got your friends, the bar's cool... Yeah. No, that's true. I think some of the girls have their eyes on you. Some of the ladies. (BOTH CHUCKLING) You don't say. I was actually this close to getting married about six years ago. Really? Mmm-hmm. I, uh, asked this girl to move in with me, you know, just to see how things would work. Her and her baby, actually. And, uh, it didn't last. She got bored real quick. (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm sorry. I don't blame her. It's hard not to get bored. I mean, there are ways, but none of them are healthy. Hell, look what had to happen for things to get interesting around here. (BLOWS) Giants attacking South Korea. No. I mean you. (DISTANT AIR RAID SIRENS) What's that? (SIGHS) Sirens in Seoul. Announcing I might show up. Then go. Wait, what are you doing? What do you mean? I thought we were going to do this together? No, Oscar, this is my thing. This is my problem. I'm confused. Why did you ask me to come out here, then? Well... I didn't... You offered! Can you just let me do it? Please, just... Yeah, okay. (KIDS YELLING, PLAYING) Oh, hold on. Okay. Yeah, you're there. (PEOPLE CLAMORING) (YELLING IN KOREAN) (AIR RAID SIRENS) (HELICOPTERS WHIRRING) Okay. It's clear. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You're fine. Go ahead. (SCREAMING) The message is clear. "I'm sorry. "It was a mistake. It won't happen again." This shocking gesture has been met by skepticism from government and military leaders. Just like I thought! It's a good monster. It's been a good guy the whole time. This confirms the creature is intelligent, understands language, at least Korean, and is eager to communicate. Many residents have decided to return to their homes. The people of Seoul have remained resilient... (NEWSCASTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) Congratulations. GARTH: I get that you don't trust the translators on the Internet, but your friend, the one at the restaurant. OSCAR: Mmm-hmm. Don't you think that he was just a little blown away when the monster wrote exactly what you told him to? I asked him to translate other phrases too, to throw him off. What kind of phrases? What does that matter? What did you tell him they were for? For tattoos. Who gets a tattoo that says, "I'm sorry, it was a mistake, it won't happen again"? That's how you beg your wife for forgiveness after you've cheated on her! (LAUGHS) I've seen weirder tattoos, I'm just... Yeah! I'm lost, and I gotta pee. All right, good. Let us know how that all turns out. Yeah, I mean, I see your point there. Yeah. No, no, no, I got it. You tattoo it backwards. OSCAR: Okay. Why backwards? I don't understand. That way, you're the only one who can read it. You're saying it to yourself. And why are you asking yourself for forgiveness? For getting a tattoo? Hi. Hey. What are you... Shh. Where do you live? What? What's your address? (KNOCKING) Hey. Hi. Come on in. Thanks. The guys still there? Yeah, they were still there when I left. They were still partying. Thank you. They, uh... They won't think it's weird? No, why would they? They don't know anything about this. (CHUCKLES) Neither do I. Mmm-hmm. Do you want something to drink, or... No? (BOTH CHUCKLE) Comfy? (CHUCKLES) (GASPS) Oh, my God! I'm sorry! Did you... Was that... (SIGHS) I'm sorry. I thought, with you coming over here, and... I'm kidding. I'm so happy to hear you say that. I just thought I had screwed it all up again, my heart's pounding... Okay. (FAINT SNORING) Oh! Oh! Joel! (GASPS) Wake up, wake up! We gotta go! We gotta go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Ah! (STAMMERING) Now! Ah! (SHOUTING) Oscar! (GRUNTING) Gloria! GLORIA: What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? OSCAR: What? We're just having a little fun! Grr! (LAUGHS) Hey, Joel. Hey, Joel. GLORIA: Oscar! Oscar! Get out of there! Turn around, walk toward the river and keep walking! Now! Wait, wait, wait. Calm down! I'm not hurting anyone, okay? We already checked. We're not fucking idiots. Shit! Oh, shit. (STAMMERS) Be careful! Aw, come on. You're the one that killed a shitload of people, not me. Spare me the lectures. Get out. (DISTANT CHEERING) I don't fucking want to. (DISTANT CHEERING) (SNIFFLES) Yeah, okay. (DISTANT CHEERING) Oh, hey. Gonna need you to go in early today. Start cleaning up the western side of the bar. If you're not too tired, obviously. Why are you asking me to do that now, Oscar? What are you talking about? You offered. (DISTANT LAUGHTER) (METAL CLANGS) REPORTER: (ON TV) After what happened this morning with the surprising turn of events, the theory shared by many has been confirmed. The two creatures are not on the same side. And the creature we first considered a threat could very well be the one protecting the city of Seoul. As is to be expected, social media websites are talking about nothing else. This is today's most watched viral video. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHING) Mmm. REPORTER 2: In other news, the monster and robot have developed a large following. People are flocking to Seoul from all over the world in hopes of catching a real-life glimpse of the phenomenon. (LIVELY CHATTER) OSCAR: Staying late tonight, right? (SIGHS) OSCAR: Really, uh... It's really well done, actually. You know? (EXPLOSIONS) The more times I watch it, the funnier it gets. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, Oscar, why don't you give it a rest? What's the problem? What, I can't think it's funny? You don't think I know how to laugh at myself? No, no, no. I just, you know... (SCOFFS) You've seen it 1,000 times. I think you might be exaggerating a little. Right? OSCAR: Uh, excuse me. No, no, no. Hold on. I'm not the one that's watched it 1,000 times. Everyone else has. You know? I mean, look how many hits this thing has. There's not this many people alive in the world. Look. Okay! Okay, you're right. Never mind. Never mind. Yeah. GLORIA: (SIGHS) Oh, God. (GLORIA SIGHS) (TOILET FLUSHES) Projection screen is down. What? Screen. It's still down. If you leave it like that overnight, it'll warp. (SCOFFS) Are you asking me to close it? I am asking you to do your job. Well, um... I got it. No. OSCAR: Hey, Garth! Don't touch it. Come on, man. It's her job. Gloria. Garth! Stay out of this, okay? In fact, why don't you just go back in the bathroom? And, oh, hey, you don't have to flush the toilet. We all know you're not taking a shit in there. Okay? What? Buddy, you can snort whatever you want in my bar. I just think it'd be nice if you trusted us a little more, that's all. We're your friends. Which is why we've turned our head for years, pretending like, you know, we don't know what you're doing when you go in the bathroom. What are... Are you crazy? You know that I have digestive issues. You don't even wipe yourself properly. Hmm. Is there something wrong with your nose? You know that I haven't snorted anything in years! I know, I know, I know that, yeah, no, everybody knows. Yeah. Very proud of you. What's with the tone? What's the problem, Garth? Taking a shit make you this nervous? Sit down. Drink your beer. It's okay. Gloria, you sure you don't want a beer? No, I'm good, Oscar, thanks. Why, 'cause you're keeping an eye on me, right? Well, don't. 'Cause I don't like when people keep tabs on me. I'm not keeping tabs on you. Then have a beer. I haven't had a beer since Sunday. (CHUCKLES) Or anything to drink, really. Why? (SIGHS) Uh, 'cause I don't want to do anything stupid. Stupid. Don't want... Stupid. Okay. GLORIA: Yeah. Stupid. You mean like the rest of us, yeah? No, Oscar, not like you. Like me. Like, stupid like when I got drunk and fell and, you know, killed hundreds of people. Like that. And when that happened, did we start checking up on you like you were a little girl. Huh? (SIGHS) Did we judge you? No! Of course not! That's not who we are. Hell, Garth here has been doing coke in secret for the last five years, no one here judges him, right? Fuck you! You can go to hell! I'm leaving. Okay. See you, buddy. You're lucky that the rest of us don't have your... I thought you were leaving! Lucky that the rest of us... You're lucky I don't call the cops on you, you junkie! (PANTING) (CHUCKLES) (BOTTLES CLATTER) Come on, Gloria. Have a beer. Okay. Well, I'll tell you what. Either you drink that beer, or I'll go take a walk through the, uh, park later. Hmm? What, are you... Are you kidding? Drink it. Please know that I'm only being this pushy because deep down, I know you want it. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) Huh. Okay. Cheers. Mmm. Oscar? Oscar, listen. Hey. Turn off everything, and lock up, please. Oscar! Oscar. Hey. Hey. Listen to me! Listen to me! You are drunk! Hey. You're drunk. Okay? Those are real people and this is just... This is not a good idea! Hey, don't worry. I'm not gonna kill anyone. Oscar! (ENGINE STARTING) I know you think everything revolves around you, but it doesn't! Not anymore. Oscar... My life is just as amazing as yours now. For once. And if you don't like it, fuck you! (GLORIA PANTING) Oh, good, you made it! I was concerned. Didn't think you were going to be here on time. Nailed it. Boy, you're pretty winded. Yeah. It's okay. We can wait. Yeah. Catch your breath. (DISTANT CHEERING) What, you're gonna slap me again? Hmm? All right. Yeah. Go. (GRUNTS) Come on. Wasn't much on that. You hit me a lot harder yesterday. Come on. Let's give them a good show. (GRUNTS) Yeah. I don't know. Not the same. Must have been the surprise... Ooh! (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (SHRIEKING) Oscar, let me go! OSCAR: No punching! Stop it! Ah! Oscar. Hey, hey, hey. Easy, slugger. GLORIA: Oscar, let me go. Come on, come on, come on. OSCAR: You hear me? No punching? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, okay. Good. (GROANING) (SHRIEKING) Oscar... Oscar, stop it. I don't want to. Oscar, you're hurting me. I don't care, all right? (GROANS) (LOUD CLANG) (DISTANT CHEERING) OSCAR: Not a direct hit, but you got the majority of them down there. (GROANS) Get out! (SIGHS) Get out. Fuck you. (BOTH GRUNTING) (DISTANT CHEERING) Ow! Ow! Ow! (DISTANT SCREAMING) (AIR RAID SIRENS) (GRUNTING) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop! Ow! JOEL: It's over! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! It's over! So just stop it! Okay? Please? It's over! Stop! Please! (GRUNTING) (COUGHING) God dang it! Shit! I think you broke the skin! Look at this! Look what you did to me! Here! There are your keys! I am not coming back to your shitty bar! Yeah, you are. Oh, yeah? Yeah. (KEYS CLINKING) Ow! You're gonna keep working at the bar, or I'm gonna come back here tomorrow and destroy an entire neighborhood. Then I'll come back and I'll kick your fucking ass! No, you won't. 'Cause I'm done being Mr. Nice Guy. (GROANS) Ow. (GASPS) See you at work? I'll see you at work. Come on, let's go! (SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (DOORBELL RINGS) Hi. Hi. Are you alone? Mmm-hmm. Uh... Look, I... I just... I wanted to say I'm sorry for... For everything that's been happening. I was with Oscar all morning, and he's sorry, too. He's so sorry that he told me to come over here and give you this. What is all this? JOEL: Well, it's... It's for you. For your house. There's, you know, a couple of rugs, and some chairs, and then, um, there's some side tables in the back and I... Well, I can unload it all myself... Gloria? Gloria, where are you going? (KNOCKING) Gloria. What the hell are you doing? Come on. Come inside. OSCAR: Uh, do you, um... Do you want some coffee, or something to drink, or... What's with the furniture in the truck, Oscar? Um... I thought I told you about that. That's from my uncle's house. They aren't using it, so, you know, you can do whatever you want with it. I don't want it! I'm totally ashamed. Yeah, well, you should be. Did I hurt you? I mean, do you have any cuts or bruises or anything like that? No. No, not really. I'm... No. Are you sure you're okay? Look. We didn't kill anybody this morning, okay? That's all that matters, right? I feel so shitty that I hurt you. I just... Such a shitty, shitty day. I can't bear to even think about it. I'm so sorry, I... I'm sorry. Please, can we be friends again? Listen, buddy, you gotta promise me something, okay? No more staying after hours at the bar, okay? You close and you go home, all right? No more late-night drinking. You promise? Okay. Okay. I promise. Yeah. (GLORIA SIGHS) I am no stranger to fucking up when drunk. It's okay. We're good. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. (DOOR CLOSES) Jesus Christ! (PANTING) (RINGTONE PLAYING) (GASPS) Tim, hey, it's... What? Hey. Come on in. Wow. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Mmm. Um, do you want, uh, a drink? Not a drink drink, but a drink? No. No, thanks. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, no, I was, uh, you know, been e-mailing you a bit, and calling you, and didn't hear anything, so I was just, uh, getting a bit worried. So when's your meeting? Hmm? Your... Uh, tomorrow morning. Have you ever been up here before? Actually, no. No, first time. We've not had a client up here. It's a pretty big coincidence you're here. Objectively speaking, it's a pretty big coincidence. Yeah, but why do you say it like that? Like what? Like, "Coincidence." You know what? No. Forget about it. Never mind. No, no, no... Drop it. 'Cause I've been dealing with a few, you know, big coincidences recently. What coincidences? You've been looking for work for a year, come home, suddenly, boop! Job. Well, (CHUCKLES) maybe I should have started out looking for a job as a waitress. Gloria, you are not a waitress! This is new. What is? Well... You've never been jealous like this before. Jealous... I'm not jealous. You think I'm jealous? GLORIA: Look, all I'm saying is it's pretty weird that you're here. (SCOFFING) No. I am not jealous. I've never been jealous, no matter how many times you've given me reason to be. I am not jealous, never been jealous, not about to be jealous... And anyway, we are not going out! No, we're not. So, doesn't matter. You can do whatever you want. Except find a job and take care of myself, right? Oh, yeah, 'cause you're really doing that. You're just... You're doing just great. Just great. You've moved back home, working as a waitress. (SCOFFS) So what? In a bar, by the way. At least your haters on the Internet will leave you alone in a bar. (SARCASTICALLY) Really moving on. Really evolving. Used to get your friends to buy you beers 'cause you had no money. Now I guess you just lean over the bar and pour yourself a cheeky one. Hmm? I used to lend you money. Now, you're just working for tips. It's great. Doing really great. (SIGHS) I gotta go. No. No. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just... No, it... I've been trying to talk to you for a while. I just... I acted like a total jerk, I'm sorry. No, I mean, I have to go to the bar. My shift is starting, so... Well, let me give you a lift. No, no, it's okay. No. No, it's fine. Look, coat. You know. I'm here. I might as well. (BAR MUSIC PLAYING) Musty. (CLEARS THROAT) Hang on. (CHUCKLES) What's going on here? Sports... Wild West... Hey, what's back there? Is that a medieval barbecue or something? What is this place? Hi. GLORIA: This is, uh... This is Tim. This is Oscar. TIM: Hello. What's up? You know, it was Gloria's idea. What? Well, see, this side of the bar had been closed for years. But Gloria here thought it was so "ironic" that she was like, "Hey, you should open this back up." And here we are. Shall we? So, what brings you into town, Tim? Um, work. Work. Mmm. Good. Work. I'm sorry, do you want anything to drink? Oh, sure, I'll, uh, take a beer. Thanks. Great. Make it two. It's good having her back in town. Yeah. And she's been a real help around here. Lot of great ideas. No, it's just a surprise, that's all. Oh, yeah? Why? You don't think she's capable of doing a job like this? Well, no, of course she's... She's capable. 'Cause anybody can do this, right? No. I mean, it's as worthy a job as anything else. Well, I'm glad you find it to be worthy. No, I just... She's never done anything like this before, you know? Hey, guys, can you please not talk about me like I'm not here? Hey, Oscar, can I have another cup of coffee, please? Actually, hold on. Don't go. One sec, Joe. Please. Sit. Tim, what would you say would be the most irresponsible thing you could do in this bar? What do you think that is? Well, for example, imagine I were to stand up right here and show you my ass. That'd be pretty rude. And yet, it's not the first time something like that's happened in here. (CHUCKLING) Not this early, of course, but it has happened. Right, Joe? JOE: Yes. Now, can I get some more coffee, please? One sec. I could take a piss over there in that corner booth, break one of those windows, you and me, we could get in a big old fistfight right here in front of everyone. (OSCAR CHUCKLES) Those would all be irresponsible things to do. But none of them are the most irresponsible thing. One sec, Joe, I'll be right with you, okay? (CRASHING, CLATTERING) (OSCAR GRUNTS) This has been sitting back there for almost 10 years now. Everybody thinks there's a bottle of fancy bourbon or something like that in here, but, well, they'd be wrong. Nope, nope, nope. This is actually the most illegal thing in this bar. Yeah. Our pal, Garth, and another buddy of mine gave it to me for my birthday a while back now. (GRUNTING) Yeah. They got it down in "Mehico" when they were there on vacation. Still can't believe they made it through customs with it. Oh. Thanks for coming in, folks! Have a good day. (CHAIR CRASHING) Watch out. Up until recently, the boys and I... We'd hop in the pick-up, we'd get a big bag of fireworks, and then we'd drive out to the suburbs. We'd light 'em all up, you know, scare the shit out of the locals, but this, this firecracker, the biggest one we ever had, never made the trip. Not that we were afraid to use it. On the contrary, we just thought it was so big we wanted to save it for a special occasion. (CHUCKLES) So we left it behind, every time. Then, we reached a point where we just grew up. Stopped screwing around like that at night. And our friend here found its way to the shelf back there. And it waited, year after year, for its big moment. (BLOWS) Joe, you might want to get out of the way. Oh, no, no, no! GLORIA: Oscar? Oscar! TIM: What are you doing? What... What's he doing? What are you doing? No, no, no... Just... Uh... Oh, God! Fuck! Go! (EXPLODES) Oh, shit! (GASPS) (SHRIEKS) (FIRE ALARM BEEPING) (GLORIA SIGHS) Okay. Let's get out of here. Okay. (CLATTERS) OSCAR: How about that, huh? (GASPS) You are a crazy person! Come on, Gloria. I just did the most irresponsible thing you could do in this bar. And you wanna know what? Even so, Gloria's not gonna leave with you. What? Of course she is. Come on. Gloria? I am leaving here at midday tomorrow. Please come with me. Gloria, I didn't have a... A meeting. I... (SIGHS) I came here for you. I lied. I'm sorry. (OSCAR TUTTING) Please. What a schmuck. (DOOR SLAMMING) (SNIFFLING) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (SCREAMS, GASPING) Jesus! (STAMMERS) I'm sorry about that. Didn't mean to scare you. What... How did you even get in here? Your parents gave my parents a copy years ago. Okay. Just leave the keys, and get out. Come on. Sit down. Take it easy. Get out. Get out, or I'll call the cops! Go ahead. (TUTS) Thank you. Now, I, uh, (SIGHS) came here because of what your boyfriend said. Ex-boyfriend. Whatever. The whole thing about you going back with him. Thought you might be thinking about it. I'm just here to make sure you don't call him. If you want to, please, go ahead. Get some sleep. I'll be right here. You've lost your mind. You know that, right? What matters now is that you don't lose yours. (SIGHS) (WIND WHOOSHING) (SIGHS) (THUNDER CRASHING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (THUNDER CRASHES) (THUNDER CRASHES) (SIGHS) What's wrong? You hate yourself. What? I used to think it was something else, that you wanted me to be yours, that you wanted to possess me, but, no, it's so much simpler than that. You hate yourself. What are you talking about? You can't stand that your life feels so small. (GLORIA SCOFFING) It's that simple. And sad. Hmm. (BAG RUSTLING) (CELL PHONE CLICKING) (SIGHS) (RINGING TONE) Tim. Listen, I can't explain now, but I'm coming with you. Okay? Bye. (SIGHS) (AIR RAID SIRENS) (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (PANTING) Um... (GROANING) Uh...

I had to fly somewhere. What do you mean "somewhere"? Ooh, uh... Are you... Are you... Are you fucking with me? Is this a joke? No, listen, I just wanted to let you know that I'm okay, and I... I'm really... I'm very sorry that I stood you up. No, are you gonna tell me what's going on here? (LIVELY CHATTER) No. Come on. I think you owe me an explanation. What? Why? No. No, I don't. Uh, when you kicked me out of your apartment, you said that I was out of control and you couldn't help me in that state. Well, buddy, right now, I am more out of control than ever.
