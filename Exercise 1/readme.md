## Overview
1st Exercise in **"Big Data analysis"** course, as part of my CS Master's degree. <br>
Main purpose: practice and demonstrate work with Spark. <br>
In this Exercise I demonstrated data manipulation capabilities using plain Pyspark as well as higher level modules, such as SparkSQL. <br>
In order to generate plots I used **matplotlib, seaborn, pandas and jupyter-gmaps** for Google Maps API consumption.



## How to run?
Run the 'run' powershell script (which is essentially a docker run with args command). <br>
When the container is up, a URL with a security token will be printed --> Open this URL in your browser.
