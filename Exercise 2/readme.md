## Associative rule learning algorithm
### Eliran Shem Tov | #ID 301806097

## Overview
2nd Exercise in **"Big Data analysis"** course, as part of my CS Master's degree. <br>
Main purpose:  implement a rule based machine learning algorithm a weakened version of Associative rule learning algorithm <br>
In this exercise, a strong requirement was set: use only the pyspark RDD API. <br>
As part of the exercise, I ingest, parse and manipulate the dataset attached in this repository, in order to demonstrate association rules to discover search engines related queries.


## Looking for the notebook itself? 
[My jupyter notebook with the assignment](https://github.com/eliranshemtov/spark_analytics_exercises/blob/master/Exercise%202/notebook/Spark_anlytics_exc2.ipynb)

## How to run?
**UnZIP the data file before running!** (The file is too big for github, so a compressed version was uploaded instead)
Run the 'run' powershell script (which is essentially a docker run with args command). <br>
When the container is up, a URL with a security token will be printed --> Open this URL in your browser.
